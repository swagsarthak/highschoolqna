What is organic chemistry, and why should you study it? The answers to these questions are all around you. Every living organism is made of organic chemicals. The proteins that make up your hair, skin, and muscles; theDNAthatcontrolsyourgeneticheritage;thefoodsthatnourishyou;andthemedicinesthathealyouareall organicchemicals.Anyonewithacuriosityaboutlifeandlivingthings,andanyonewhowantstobeapartof the remarkable advances taking place in medicine and the biological sciences, must first understand organic chemistry.Lookatthefollowingdrawingsforinstance,whichshowthechemicalstructuresofsomemolecules whose names might be familiar to you. Although the drawings may appear unintelligible at this point, don’t worry. They’ll make perfectly good sense before long, and you’ll soon be drawing similar structures for any substance you’re interested in. Historically, the termorganic chemistrydates to the mid-1700s, when it was used to mean the chemistry of substances found in living organisms. Little was known about chemistry at that time, and the behavior of the “organic”substancesisolatedfromplantsandanimalsseemeddifferentfromthatofthe“inorganic”substances found in minerals. Organic compounds were generally low-melting solids and were usually more difficult to isolate, purify, and work with than high-melting inorganic compounds. By the mid-1800s, however, it was clear that there was no fundamental difference between organic and inorganic compounds. The only distinguishing characteristic of organic compounds is that all contain the element carbon. Organic chemistry, then, is the study of carbon compounds. But why is carbon special? Why, of the more than 197 million presently known chemical compounds, do almost all of them contain carbon? The answers to these questions come from carbon’s electronic structure and its consequent position in the periodic table (FIGURE 1.2). As a group 4A element, carbon can share four valence electrons and form four strong covalent bonds.Furthermore,carbonatomscanbondtooneanother,forminglongchainsandrings.Carbon,aloneofall elements,isabletoformanimmensediversityofcompounds,fromthesimplemethane,withonecarbonatom, to the staggeringly complex DNA, which can have more than FIGURE 1.2 Carbon, hydrogen, and other elements commonly found in organic compounds are shown in the colors typically used to represent them."}

The nucleus consistsofsubatomicparticlescalled neutrons, whichareelectricallyneutral,and protons, whicharepositively charged.Becauseanatomisneutraloverall,thenumberofpositiveprotonsinthenucleusandthenumberof negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same. FIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom.The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom’s mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The three-dimensional view on the right shows calculated electron-density surfaces. Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at theblue solid surface than at thegray mesh surface. Although extremely small—about 10–14 to 10–15 meter (m) in diameter—the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom. Electrons have negligible mass and circulate around the nucleus at a distanceofapproximately10 –10m.Thus,thediameterofatypicalatomisabout2×10 –10m,or200picometers (pm), where 1 pm = 10–12 m. To give you an idea of how small this is, a thin pencil line is about 3 million carbonatomswide.AlthoughmostchemiststhroughouttheworldusetheInternationalSystem(SI)ofunitsand describesmalldistancesinpicometers,manyorganicchemistsandbiochemistsintheUnitedStatesstilluse theunitangstrom(Å)toexpressatomicdistances,where1Å=100pm=10 –10m.Asyouprobablydidinyour general chemistry course, however, we’ll stay with SI units in this book.

When the square of the wave function,ψ2, is plotted in three-dimensional space, an orbital describes the volume of space around a nucleus that an electron is most likely to occupy. You might therefore think of an orbital as looking like a photograph of the electron taken at a slow shutter speed. In such a photo, the orbital would appear as a blurry cloud, indicating the region of space where the electron has been.

(a) Magnesium (b) Cobalt (c) Selenium 1.4Development of Chemical Bonding Theory By the mid-1800s, the new science of chemistry was developing rapidly, especially in Europe, and chemists had begun to probe the forces holding compounds together. In 1858, the German chemist August Kekulé andtheScottishchemistArchibaldCouperindependentlyproposedthat,inallorganiccompounds,carbonis tetravalent—it alwaysformsfourbondswhenitjoinsotherelementstoformstablecompounds.Furthermore, saidKekulé,carbonatomscanbondtooneanothertoformextendedchainsoflinkedatoms.In1865,Kekulé providedanothermajoradvancewhenhesuggestedthatcarbonchainscandoublebackonthemselvestoform ringsof atoms. Although Kekulé and Couper were correct in describing the tetravalent nature of carbon, chemistry was still viewed in a two-dimensional way until 1874. In that year, the Dutch chemist Jacobus van’t Hoff and French chemistJosephLeBeladdedathirddimensiontoourideasaboutorganiccompoundswhentheyproposedthat the four bonds of carbon are not oriented randomly but have specific spatial directions. Van’t Hoff went even furtherandsuggestedthatthefouratomstowhichcarbonisbondedsitatthecornersofaregulartetrahedron, with carbon in the center.

Why, though, do atoms bond together, and how can chemical bonds be described electronically? Thewhy question is relatively easy to answer: atoms bond together because the compound that results is more stable andlowerinenergythantheseparateatoms.Energy—usuallyasheat—isalwaysreleasedandflowsoutofthe chemicalsystemwhenabondforms.Conversely,energyisaddedtothechemicalsystemwhenabondbreaks. Making bonds always releases energy, and breaking bonds always absorbs energy. The howquestion is more difficult. To answer it, we need to know more about the electronic properties of atoms.

Wealsoknowthatthechemistryofthemain-groupelementsontheleftandrightsides of the periodic table is governed by their tendency to take on the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas. The alkali metals such as sodium in group 1A, for example, achieve a noble-gas configuration by losing the single s electron from their valence shell to form a cation, while the halogens such as chlorine in group 7Aachieveanoble-gasconfigurationbygaininga pelectron tofilltheirvalenceshellandformananion.The resultantionsareheldtogetherincompoundslikeNa +Cl–bytheelectricalattractionofunlikechargesthatwe call anionic bond. But how do elements closer to the middle of the periodic table form bonds? Look at methane, CH4, the main constituent of natural gas, for example. The bonding in methane is not ionic because it would take too much energy for carbon (1 s2 2s2 2p2) either to gain or lose four electrons to achieve a noble-gas configuration. Instead,carbonbondstootheratoms,notbygainingorlosingelectrons,butby sharingthem. Suchashared- electron bond, first proposed in 1916 by the American chemist G. N. Lewis, is called acovalent bond.

Ionic compounds such as sodium chloride, however, are not called molecules. A simple way of indicating the covalent bonds in molecules is to use what are calledLewis structures, or electron-dot structures, in which the valence-shell electrons of an atom are represented as dots. Thus, hydrogenhasonedotrepresentingits1 selectron, carbonhasfourdots(2 s22p2), oxygenhassixdots(2 s22p4), and so on. A stable molecule results whenever a noble-gas configuration of eight dots (an octet) is achieved for all main-group atoms or two dots for hydrogen.

How can we explain this? An answer was provided in 1931 by Linus Pauling, who showed mathematically how ans orbital and three p orbitals on an atom can combine, orhybridize, to form four equivalent atomic orbitals with tetrahedral orientation. Shown inFIGURE 1.11, these tetrahedrally oriented orbitals are calledsp3 hybrid orbitals. Note thatthesuperscript3inthename sp3tells howmanyofeachtypeofatomicorbitalcombinetoformthehybrid, not how many electrons occupy it. FIGURE 1.11 Four sp3 hybrid orbitals, oriented toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, are formed by the combination of an s orbital and three p orbitals (red/blue).

Just as anatomic orbital, whether unhybridized or hybridized,describesaregionofspacearoundan atomwhere anelectronislikelytobefound,soa molecular orbital describes a region of space in amoleculewhere electrons are most likely to be found. Like an atomic orbital, a molecular orbital has a specific size, shape, and energy. In the H2 molecule, for example, two singly occupied 1satomic orbitals combine to form two molecular orbitals. There are two ways for the orbital combination to occur—an additive way and a subtractive way. The additive combination leads to formation of a molecular orbital that is lower in energy and roughly egg-shaped, while the subtractive combinationleadstoamolecularorbitalthatishigherinenergyandhasanodebetweennuclei(FIGURE 1.18).

Topics such as bond polarity, the acid–base behavior of molecules, and hydrogen-bonding are a particularly important part of that foundation. Wesawinthepreviouschapterhowcovalentbondsbetweenatomsaredescribed,andwelookedatthevalence bondmodel,whichuseshybridorbitalstoaccountfortheobservedshapesoforganicmolecules.Beforegoing on to a systematic study of organic chemistry, however, we still need to review a few fundamental topics. In particular,weneedtolookmorecloselyathowelectronsaredistributedincovalentbondsandatsomeofthe consequences that arise when the electrons in a bond are not shared equally between atoms. 2.1Polar Covalent Bonds and Electronegativity Up to this point, we’ve treated chemical bonds as either ionic or covalent. The bond in sodium chloride, for instance, is ionic. Sodium transfers an electron to chlorine to produce Na+ and Cl– ions, which are held together in the solid by electrostatic attractions between unlike charges. The C–C bond in ethane, however, is covalent. The two bonding electrons are shared equally by the two equivalent carbon atoms, resulting in a symmetrical electron distribution in the bond. Most bonds, however, are neither fully ionic nor fully covalent butaresomewherebetweenthetwoextremes.Suchbondsarecalled polarcovalentbonds,meaningthatthe bonding electrons are attracted more strongly by one atom than the other so that the electron distribution between atoms is not symmetrical (FIGURE 2.2). FIGURE 2.2 The continuum in bonding from covalent to ionic is a result of an unequal distribution of bonding electrons between atoms. The symbolδ (lowercase Greek letter delta) meanspartial charge, either partial positive (δ+) for the electron-poor atom or partial negative (δ–) for the electron-rich atom.

We’ll make frequent use of these maps throughout the text and will see many examples of how electronic structure correlates with chemical reactivity. When speaking of an atom’s ability to polarize a bond, we often use the term inductive effect.An inductive effectis simplytheshiftingofelectronsina σ bond inresponsetotheelectronegativityofnearbyatoms.Metals, such as lithium and magnesium, inductively donate electrons, whereas reactive nonmetals, such as oxygen and nitrogen, inductively withdraw electrons. Inductive effects play a major role in understanding chemical reactivity, and we’ll use them many times throughout this text to explain a variety of chemical observations.

As a practical matter, strongly polar substances are often soluble in polar solvents like water, whereas less polar substances are insoluble in water. Net polarity is measured by a quantity called the dipole momentand can be thought of in the following way: assumethatthereisacenterofmassofallpositivecharges(nuclei)inamoleculeandacenterofmassofall negative charges (electrons). If these two centers don’t coincide, then the molecule has a net polarity.

Dipolemomentsareexpressedin debyes(D), where1D=3.336×10 –30 coulombmeters(C·m)inSIunits.Forexample,theunitchargeonan electronis1.60×10 –19C.Thus,ifonepositivechargeandonenegativechargeareseparatedby100pm(abit less than the length of a typical covalent bond), the dipole moment is 1.60 × 10–29C · m, or 4.80 D. Dipolemomentsforsomecommonsubstancesaregivenin TABLE 2.1.Ofthecompoundsshowninthetable, sodium chloride has the largest dipole moment (9.00 D) because it is ionic. Even small molecules like water (μ = 1.85 D), methanol (CH3OH; μ = 1.70 D), and ammonia (μ = 1.47 D), have substantial dipole moments, however, both because they contain strongly electronegative atoms (oxygen and nitrogen) and because all threemoleculeshavelone-pairelectrons.Thelone-pairelectronsonoxygenandnitrogenstickoutintospace away from the positively charged nuclei, giving rise to a considerable charge separation and making a large contribution to the dipole moment.

Formal charges, as the name suggests, are a formalism and don’t imply the presence of actual ionic charges inamolecule.Instead,they’readeviceforelectron“bookkeeping”andcanbethoughtofinthefollowingway: A typical covalent bond is formed when each atom donates one electron. Although the bonding electrons are shared by both atoms, each atom can still be considered to “own” one electron for bookkeeping purposes. In methane, for instance, the carbon atom owns one electron in each of the four C–H bonds. Because a neutral, isolatedcarbonatomhasfourvalenceelectrons,andbecausethecarbonatominmethanestillownsfour,the methane carbon atom is neutral and has no formal charge.

This symmetrical distribution of electrons around the molecule is evident in an\n\nelectrostatic potential map. 2.5Rules for Resonance Forms Whenfirstdealingwithresonanceforms,it’susefultohaveasetofguidelinesthatdescribehowtodrawand interpret them. The following rules should be helpful: RULE 1 Individualresonanceformsareimaginary,notreal.Therealstructureisacomposite,orresonancehybrid, of the different forms. Species such as the acetate ion and benzene are no different from any other. They have single, unchanging structures, and they don't switch back and forth between resonance forms. The only difference between these and other substances is in the way they are represented in drawings. RULE 2 Resonanceformsdifferonlyintheplacementoftheir πor nonbondingelectrons.Neitherthepositionnor thehybridizationofanyatomchangesfromoneresonanceformtoanother.Intheacetateion,forinstance,the carbonatomis sp2-hybridized andtheoxygenatomsremaininexactlythesameplaceinbothresonanceforms. Only the positions of theπelectrons in the bond and the lone-pair electrons on oxygen differ from one form to another. This movement of electrons from one resonance structure to another can be indicated with curved arrows. A curved arrow always indicates the movement of electrons, not the movement of atoms.An arrow showsthatapairofelectronsmoves fromthe atomorbondatthetailofthearrow tothe atomorbondat the head of the arrow. Thesituationwithbenzeneissimilartothatwithacetate.The πelectrons inthedoublebondsmove,asshown with curved arrows, but the carbon and hydrogen atoms remain in place.

Thetworesonanceformsdiffersimplybyanexchangeinpositionofthemultiplebondandtheasteriskfrom one end of the three-atom grouping to the other. By learning to recognize such three-atom groupings within larger structures, resonance forms can be systematicallygenerated.Look,forinstance,attheanionproducedwhenH +isremovedfrom2,4-pentanedione by reaction with a base. How many resonance structures does the resultant anion have?\n\nThe 2,4-pentanedione anion has a lone pair of electrons and a formal negative charge on the central carbon atom, next to a bond on the left. The grouping is a typical one for which two resonance structures can be drawn. Justasthereisa bondtotheleftofthelonepair,thereisasecond bondtotheright.Thus,wecan draw a total of three resonance structures for the 2,4-pentanedione anion.

Collectively called either intermolecular forces, van der Waals forces, or noncovalent interactions, they are of several different types: dipole–dipole forces, dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonds. Dipole–dipole forces occur between polar molecules as a result of electrostatic interactions among dipoles. Theforcescanbeeitherattractiveorrepulsivedependingontheorientationofthemolecules—attractivewhen unlike charges are together and repulsive when like charges are together. The attractive geometry is lower in energy and therefore predominates (FIGURE 2.7).

Which is which?\n\nCHEMISTRY MATTERS Alkaloids: From Cocaine to Dental Anesthetics Just as ammonia (NH3) is a weak base, there are a large number of nitrogen-containing organic compounds called amines that are also weak bases. In the early days of organic chemistry, basic amines derived from naturalsourceswereknownasvegetablealkali,buttheyarenowcalled alkaloids.Morethan20,000alkaloids are known. Their study provided much of the impetus for the growth of organic chemistry in the nineteenth century and remains today an active and fascinating area of research. FIGURE 2.9 The coca bushErythroxylon coca,nativet o upland rain forest areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and western Brazil, is the source of the alkaloid cocaine. (credit: \"Erythroxylum coca\" by Danna Guevara/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0) Manyalkaloids havepronouncedbiologicalproperties,andapproximately50%ofpharmaceuticalagentsused today are derived from naturally occurring amines. As just three examples, morphine, an analgesic agent (painkiller), is obtained from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum. Ephedrine, a bronchodilator, decongestant, and appetite suppressant, is obtained fromEphedra sinica, an evergreen shrub native to MongoliaandnortheasternChina.Cocaine,bothananestheticandastimulant,isobtainedfromthecocabush Erythroxyloncoca, endemicto theuplandrainforestareasofcentralSouthAmerica.(Andyes,therereallywas a small amount of cocaine in the original Coca-Cola recipe, although it was removed in 1906.) Cocaine itself is rarely used medically because it is too addictive, but its anesthetic properties provoked a long search for related but nonaddictive compounds. This search ultimately resulted in the synthesis of the “caine” anesthetics that are commonly used today in dental and surgical anesthesia. Procaine, the first such compound, was synthesized in 1898 and marketed under the name Novocain. It was rapidly adopted and remainsinusetodayasatopicalanesthetic.Otherrelatedcompoundswithdifferentactivityprofilesfollowed: Lidocaine,marketedasXylocaine,wasintroducedin1943,andmepivacaine(Carbocaine)intheearly1960s.

In this chapter, we’ve reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters. Organic molecules often havepolar covalent bondsas a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in theelectronegativity of atoms. A carbon–oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attractsthesharedelectronsmorestronglythancarbondoes.Carbon–hydrogenbondsarerelativelynonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by itsdipole moment, μ.

Look atTABLE 3.1, which lists many of the common functional groups and gives simple examples of their occurrence. Some functional groups have only carbon–carbon double or triple bonds; others have halogen atoms; and still others contain oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Much of the chemistry you’ll be studying is the chemistry of these functional groups. Functional Groups with Carbon–Carbon Multiple Bonds Alkenes, alkynes, and arenes (aromatic compounds) all contain carbon–carbon multiple bonds. Alkeneshave a double bond,alkynes have a triple bond, andarenes have alternating double and single bonds in a six- memberedringofcarbonatoms.Theylookdifferent,butbecauseoftheirstructuralsimilarities,theyalsohave chemical similarities.\n\nTABLE 3.1Structures of Some Common Functional Groups Name Structure* Name ending Example Alkene (double bond) -ene Ethene Alkyne (triple bond) -yne Ethyne Arene (aromatic ring) None Halide (X=F, Cl, Br, I) None CH3Cl Chloromethane Alcohol -ol CH3OH Methanol Ether ether CH3OCH3 Dimethyl ether Monophosphate phosphate CH3OPO32− Methyl phosphate Diphosphate diphosphate CH3OP2O63− Methyl diphosphate 3.1 • Functional Groups 73\n\nTABLE 3.1Structures of Some Common Functional Groups Name Structure* Name ending Example Amine -amine CH3NH2 Methylamine Imine (Schiff base) None Nitrile -nitrile Ethanenitrile Thiol -thiol CH3SH Methanethiol Sulfide sulfide CH3SCH3 Dimethyl sulfide Disulfide disulfide CH3SSCH3 Dimethyl disulfide Sulfoxide sulfoxide Aldehyde -al Ketone -one Carboxylic acid -oic acid Ester -oate Thioester -thioate"}

These compounds therefore behave similarly in many respects but differ depending on the identity of the otheratomsbondedtothecarbonyl-groupcarbon.

Think about the ways that carbon and hydrogen might combine to make alkanes. With one carbon and four hydrogens, only one structure is possible: methane, CH4. Similarly, there is only one combination of two carbonswithsixhydrogens(ethane,CH 3CH3)andonlyonecombinationofthreecarbonswitheighthydrogens (propane, CH3CH2CH3). When larger numbers of carbons and hydrogens combine, however, more than one structureispossible.Forexample,therearetwosubstanceswiththeformulaC 4H10:thefourcarbonscanall beinarow(butane),ortheycanbranch(isobutane).Similarly,therearethreeC 5H12 molecules,andsoonfor larger alkanes.\n\nCompounds like butane and pentane, whose carbons are all connected in a row, are calledstraight-chain alkanes, or normal alkanes. Compounds like 2-methylpropane (isobutane), 2-methylbutane, and 2,2-dimethylpropane, whose carbon chains branch, are calledbranched-chain alkanes.

The system of naming (nomenclature) we’ll use in thisbookisthatdevisedbytheInternationalUnionofPureandAppliedChemistry(IUPAC,usuallyspokenas eye-you-pac). A chemical name typically has four parts in the IUPAC system: parent, prefix, locant, and suffix. Theparent name identifies the main part of the molecule and tells how many carbon atoms are in that part.Prefixes identify the varioussubstituent groups attached to the parent.Locants give the positions of the attached substituents. And thesuffixidentifies the primary functional group attached to the parent. Aswecovernewfunctionalgroupsinlaterchapters,theapplicableIUPACrulesofnomenclaturewillbegiven.

Another effect seen in alkanes is that increased branching lowers an alkane’s boiling point. Thus, pentane hasnobranchesandboilsat36.1°C,isopentane(2-methylbutane)hasonebranchandboilsat27.85°C,and neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane) has two branches and boils at 9.5 °C. Similarly, octane boils at 125.7 °C, whereasisooctane(2,2,4-trimethylpentane)boilsat99.3°C.Branched-chainalkanesarelower-boilingbecause theyaremorenearlysphericalthanstraight-chainalkanes,havesmallersurfaceareas,andconsequentlyhave smaller dispersion forces. 3.6Conformations of Ethane Upuntilnow,we’veviewedmoleculesprimarilyinatwo-dimensionalwayandhavegivenlittlethoughttoany consequencesthatmightarisefromthespatialarrangementofatomsinmolecules.Nowit’stimetoaddathird dimension to our study.Stereochemistry is the branch of chemistry concerned with the three-dimensional aspectsofmolecules.We’llseeonmanyoccasionsinfuturechaptersthattheexactthree-dimensionalstructure of a molecule is often crucial to determining its properties and biological behavior. Weknowfrom Section 1.5that σ bonds arecylindricallysymmetrical.Inotherwords,theintersectionofaplane cuttingthroughacarbon–carbonsingle-bondorbitallookslikeacircle.Becauseofthiscylindricalsymmetry, rotation is possible around carbon–carbon bonds in open-chain molecules. In ethane, for instance, rotation aroundtheC–Cbondoccursfreely,constantlychangingthespatialrelationshipsbetweenthehydrogensonone carbon and those on the other (FIGURE 3.6). FIGURE 3.6Rotation occurs around the carbon–carbon single bond in ethane because of σ bond cylindrical symmetry. The differentarrangementsofatomsthatresultfrombondrotationarecalled conformations,andmolecules that have different arrangements are calledconformational isomers, orconformers. Unlike constitutional isomers, however, different conformers often can’t be isolated because they interconvert too rapidly. Conformational isomers are represented in two ways, as shown inFIGURE 3.7. Asawhorse representation views the carbon–carbon bond from an oblique angle and indicates spatial orientation by showing all C–H bonds. ANewman projectionviews the carbon–carbon bond directly end-on and represents the two carbon atoms by a circle.

It won’t be around forever. (credit: “The first oil well” (https://www.loc.gov/item/ 2010649522/)by Unknown/Library of Congress) The petroleum era began in August 1859, when the world’s first oil well was drilled by Edwin Drake near Titusville,Pennsylvania.Thep etroleumwasdistilledintofractionsac cordingtob oilingpoint,butitw ashigh- boiling kerosene, or lamp oil, rather than gasoline that was primarily sought.

Petroleum refining begins by fractional distillation of crude oil into three principal cuts according to boiling point(bp):straight-rungasoline(bp30–200°C),k erosene(bp175–300°C),andhe atingoil,ordieselfuel( bp 275–400 °C). Further distillation under reduced pressure then yields lubricating oils and waxes and leaves a tarry residue of asphalt. The distillation of crude oil is only the first step in gasoline production, however. Straight-run gasoline turns out to be a poor fuel in automobiles because of engine knock, an uncontrolled combustion that can occur in a hot engine causing potentially serious damage. 3 • Chemistry Matters 97"}

Because cyclic molecules are encountered in most pharmaceuticals and in all classes of biomolecules, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids, it’s important to understand the behavior of cyclic structures. Although we’ve only discussed open-chain compounds up to now, most organic compounds contain rings of carbon atoms.

We’ll discuss steroids and their properties in more detail inSections 27.6and27.7. 4.1Naming Cycloalkanes Saturated cyclic hydrocarbons are calledcycloalkanes, oralicyclic compounds (aliphaticcyclic). Because cycloalkanes consist of rings of −CH2−units, they have the general formula (CH2)n, or CnH2n, and can be represented by polygons in skeletal drawings. Substituted cycloalkanes are named by rules similar to those we saw in (Section 3.4) for open-chain alkanes. For most compounds, there are only two steps. STEP 1 Find the parent. Count the number of carbon atoms in the ring and the number in the largest substituent. If the number of carbonatomsintheringisequaltoorgreaterthanthenumberinthesubstituent,thecompoundisnamedas an alkyl-substituted cycloalkane. If the number of carbon atoms in the largest substituent is greater than the number in the ring, the compound is named as a cycloalkyl-substituted alkane. For example:\n\nNumber the substituents, and write the name. For an alkyl- or halo-substituted cycloalkane, choose a point of attachment as carbon 1 and number the substituentsontheringsothatthe secondsubstituenthas aslowanumberaspossible.Ifambiguitystillexists, number so that the third or fourth substituent has as low a number as possible, until a point of difference is found.

The common ring sizes (C3–C7), however, are severely restricted in their molecular motions.\n\nBecause of their cyclic structures, cycloalkanes have two faces when viewed edge-on, a “top” face and a “bottom” face. As a result, isomerism is possible in substituted cycloalkanes. For example, there are two different1,2-dimethylcyclopropaneisomers,onewiththetwomethylgroupsonthesamefaceoftheringand one with the methyl groups on opposite faces (FIGURE 4.3). Both isomers are stable compounds, and neither can be converted into the other without breaking and reforming chemical bonds.

Unliketheconstitutionalisomersbutaneandisobutane,whichhavetheiratomsconnectedinadifferentorder (Section 3.2), the two 1,2-dimethylcyclopropanes have the same order of connections but differ in the spatial orientation of the atoms. Such compounds, with atoms connected in the same order but differing in three- dimensional orientation, are called stereochemical isomers, orstereoisomers. As we saw inSection 3.6, the term stereochemistry is used generally to refer to the three-dimensional aspects of structure and reactivity. The 1,2-dimethylcyclopropanes are members of a subclass of stereoisomers calledcis–trans isomers. The prefixes cis- (Latin “on the same side”) andtrans- (Latin “across”) are used to distinguish between them. Cis–trans isomerism is a common occurrence in substituted cycloalkanes and in many cyclic biological molecules.

As a result, angle strain occurs only in three- and four- membered rings, which have little flexibility.

Thus, three kinds of strain contribute to the overall energy of a cycloalkane. • Angle strain—the strain due to expansion or compression of bond angles • Torsional strain—the strain due to eclipsing of bonds between neighboring atoms • Steric strain—the strain due to repulsive interactions when atoms approach each other too closely PROBLEM 4-8 Each H⟷ H eclipsing interaction in ethane costs about 4.0 kJ/mol.

As shown inFIGURE 4.12, a chair cyclohexane can be ring-flipped by keeping the middle four carbon atoms in place while folding the two end carbons in opposite directions. In so doing, an axial substituent in one chair form becomes an equatorial substituent in the ring-flipped chair form and vice versa. For example, axial bromocyclohexane becomes equatorial bromocyclohexane after a ring-flip.

The same is true of other monosubstituted cyclohexanes: a substituent is almost always more stable in an equatorial position than in an axial position.

Cycloalkanes are saturated cyclic hydrocarbons with the general formula C nH2n. In contrast to open-chain alkanes, where nearly free rotation occurs around C−C bonds, rotation is greatly reduced in cycloalkanes. Disubstituted cycloalkanes can therefore exist ascis–trans isomers. The cis isomer has both substituents on the same side of the ring; the trans isomer has substituents on opposite sides. Cis–trans isomers are just one kind ofstereoisomer—compounds that have the same connections between atoms but different three- dimensional arrangements.

Cyclopropane (115 kJ/mol strain) and cyclobutane (110.4 kJ/mol strain) have both angle strain and torsional strain. Cyclopentane is free of angle strain but has a substantial torsional strain due to its large number of eclipsing interactions.

Try it. Handednessisalsoimportantinorganicandbiologicalchemistry,whereitarisesprimarilyasaconsequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry ofsp3-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies—amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more—have a handedness. Furthermore, molecularhandednessenablesthepreciseinteractionsbetweenenzymesandtheirsubstratesthatareinvolved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based. 5.1Enantiomers and the Tetrahedral Carbon What causes molecular handedness? Look at generalized molecules of the type CH3X, CH2XY, and CHXYZ shown inFIGURE 5.2. On the left are three molecules, and on the right are their images reflected in a mirror. The CH3X and CH2XY molecules are identical to their mirror images and thus are not handed. If you make a molecular model of each molecule and its mirror image, you find that you can superimpose one on the other so that all atoms coincide. The CHXYZ molecule, by contrast, is not identical to its mirror image. You can’tsuperimposeamodelofthismoleculeonamodelofitsmirrorimageforthesamereasonthatyoucan’t superimpose a left hand on a right hand: they simply aren’t the same. FIGURE 5.2Tetrahedral carbon atoms and their mirror images.MoleculesofthetypeCH 3XandCH 2XYareidenticaltotheirmirrorimages, but a molecule of the type CHXYZ is not. A CHXYZ molecule is related to its mirror image in the same way a right hand is related to a left hand. Amoleculethatisnotidenticaltoitsmirrorimageisakindofstereoisomer(Section 4.2)calledan enantiomer (e-nan-tee-oh-mer, from the Greek enantio, meaning “opposite”). Enantiomers are related to each other as a right hand is related to a left hand and result whenever a tetrahedral carbon is bonded to four different substituents (one need not be H). For example, lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) exists as a pair of enantiomers because there are four different groups (−H, −OH, −CH3, −CO2H) bonded to the central carbon atom.Theenantiomersarecalled(+)-lacticacidand(−)-lacticacid.Botharefoundinsourmilk,butonlythe(+) enantiomer occurs in muscle tissue."}

You can’t take a chiral molecule and its enantiomer and place one on the other so that all atoms coincide. How can you predict whether a given molecule is or is not chiral?

FIGURE 5.5 The achiral propanoic acid molecule versus the chiral lactic acid molecule.Propanoic acid has a plane of symmetry that makes one side of the molecule a mirror image of the other. Lactic acid has no such symmetry plane. Themostcommon,althoughnottheonly,causeofchiralityinorganicmoleculesisthepresenceofatetrahedral carbonatombondedtofourdifferentgroups—forexample,thecentralcarbonatominlacticacid.Suchcarbons are referred to aschirality centers, although other terms such as stereocenter, asymmetric center, and stereogenic center have also been used. Note that chirality is a property of the entire molecule, whereas a chiralitycenteris thecauseof chirality. Detecting achiralitycenterinacomplexmoleculetakespracticebecauseit’snotalwaysimmediatelyapparent whether four different groups are bonded to a given carbon. The differences don’t necessarily appear right next to the chirality center.

A butyl substituent is similar to a pentyl substituent,butitisn’tidentical.Thedifferenceisn’tapparentuntillookingfourcarbonatomsawayfromthe chirality center, but there’s still a difference. As other possible examples, look at methylcyclohexane and 2-methylcyclohexanone. Methylcyclohexane is achiral because no carbon atom in the molecule is bonded to four different groups.

Today, we would describe Pasteur’s work by saying that he had discovered enantiomers.Enantiomers, also calledopticalisomers,haveidenticalphysicalproperties,suchasmeltingpointandboilingpoint,butdifferin the direction in which their solutions rotate plane-polarized light. 5.5Sequence Rules for Specifying Configuration Structural drawings provide a visual representation of stereochemistry, but a written method for indicating thethree-dimensionalarrangement,or configuration,ofsubstituentsatachiralitycenterisalsoneeded.The methodusedasetof sequencerules torankthefourgroupsattachedtothechiralitycenterandthenlooksat thehandednesswithwhichthosegroupsareattached.Calledthe Cahn–Ingold–Prelogrules afterthechemists who proposed them, the sequence rules are as follows: RULE 1 Lookatthefouratomsdirectlyattachedtothechiralitycenter,andrankthemaccordingtoatomicnumber. Theatomwiththehighestatomicnumberhasthehighestranking(first),andtheatomwiththelowestatomic number (usually hydrogen) has the lowest ranking (fourth). When different isotopes of the same element are compared,suchasdeuterium( 2H)andprotium( 1H),theheavierisotoperankshigherthanthelighterisotope. Thus, atoms commonly found in organic compounds have the following order. RULE 2 If a decision can’t be reached by ranking the first atoms in the substituent, look at the second, third, or fourthatomsawayfromthechiralitycenteruntilthefirstdifferenceisfound. A−CH2CH3 substituentand a −CH3 substituent are equivalent by rule 1 because both have carbon as the first atom. By rule 2, however, ethyl ranks higher than methyl because ethyl has a carbon as its highest second atom, while methyl has only hydrogen as its second atom. Look at the following pairs of examples to see how the rule works: RULE 3 Multiple-bonded atoms are equivalent to the same number of single-bonded atoms.For example, an aldehyde substituent ( ), which has a carbon atomdoubly bonded to one oxygen, is equivalent to a substituent having a carbon atomsinglybonded totwooxygens: 5.5 • Sequence Rules for Specifying Configuration 143"}

The answer is that Pasteur started with a 50:50 mixture of the two chiral tartaric acid enantiomers. Such a mixture is called aracemate (rass-uh-mate), orracemic mixture,and is denoted by either the symbol (±) or the prefix d,l to indicate an equal mixture of dextrorotatory and levorotatory forms. Racemates show no optical rotation because the (+) rotation from one enantiomer exactly cancels the (−) rotation from the other. Through good luck, Pasteur was able to separate, or resolve, racemic tartaric acid into its (+) and (−) enantiomers.Unfortunately,thefractionalcrystallizationtechniqueheuseddoesn’tworkformostracemates, so other methods are needed.

Although that atom is usually carbon, it doesn’t necessarily have to be. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms are all commonly encountered in organic molecules, and can all be chirality centers. We know, for instance, that trivalent nitrogen is tetrahedral, with its lone pair of electronsactingasthefourth“substituent”(Section 1.10).Istrivalentnitrogenchiral?Doesacompoundsuch as ethylmethylamine exist as a pair of enantiomers? The answer is both yes and no. Yes in principle, but no in practice. It turns out that most trivalent nitrogen compounds undergo a rapid umbrella-like inversion that interconverts enantiomers, so we can’t isolate individual enantiomers except in special cases. 5.10 • Chirality at Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur 155"}

We’llseetheimportanceofphosphinechiralityin Section26.7 inconnectionwiththesynthesisofchiralamino acids. Divalent sulfur compounds are achiral, but trivalent sulfur compounds calledsulfonium salts(R3S+) can be chiral. Like phosphines, sulfonium salts undergo relatively slow inversion, so chiral sulfonium salts are configurationally stable and can be isolated. Perhaps the best known example is the coenzyme S-adenosylmethionine, the so-called biological methyl donor, which is involved in many metabolic pathways as a source of CH3 groups. (The “S” in the nameS-adenosylmethionine stands forsulfur and means that the adenosyl group is attached to the sulfur atom of the amino acid methionine.) The molecule hasS stereochemistry atsulfurandisconfigurationallystableforseveraldaysatroomtemperature.Its Renantiomer is also known but is not biologically active. 5.11Prochirality Closely related to the concept of chirality, and particularly important in biological chemistry, is the notion of prochirality.A moleculeissaidtobe prochiralifitcanbeconvertedfromachiraltochiralinasinglechemical step. For instance, an unsymmetrical ketone like 2-butanone is prochiral because it can be converted to the chiral alcohol 2-butanol by the addition of hydrogen, as we’ll see inSection 17.4.

In addition to compounds with planar,sp2-hybridized atoms, compounds with tetrahedral,sp3-hybridized atoms can also be prochiral. Ansp3-hybridized atom is said to be aprochirality centerif, by changing one of its attached groups, it becomes a chirality center. The −CH2OH carbon atom of ethanol, for instance, is a prochirality center because changing one of its attached −H atoms converts it into a chirality center. To distinguish between the two identical atoms (or groups of atoms) on a prochirality center, we imagine a change that will raise the ranking of one atom over the other without affecting its rank with respect to other attached groups. On the −CH2OH carbon of ethanol, for instance, we might imagine replacing one of the1H atoms(protium)by 2H(deuterium).Thenewlyintroduced 2Hatomrankshigherthantheremaining 1Hatom, but it remains lower than other groups attached to the carbon.

Why do different enantiomers have different biological properties? To have a biological effect, a substance typically must fit into an appropriate receptor that has a complementary shape. But because biological receptors are chiral, only one enantiomer of a chiral substrate can fit, just as only a right hand can fit into a right-handed glove. The mirror-image enantiomer will be a misfit, like a left hand in a right-handed glove.

Tounderstandbothorganicandbiologicalchemistry,it’snecessarytoknownotjust whatoccurs butalso why andhowchemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we’ll start with an overview of the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we’ll see why reactions occur, and we’ll see how reactions can be described. Once this background is out of the way, we’ll then be ready to begin studying the details of organic chemistry in future chapters. When first approached, organic chemistry might seem overwhelming. It’s not so much that any one part is difficult to understand, it’s that there are so many parts: tens of millions of compounds, dozens of functional groups,andanapparentlyendlessnumberofreactions.Withstudy,though,itbecomesevidentthatthereare only a few fundamental ideas that underlie all organic reactions. Far from being a collection of isolated facts, organicchemistryisabeautifullylogicalsubjectthatisunifiedbyafewbroadthemes.Whenthesethemesare understood,learningorganicchemistrybecomesmucheasierandmemorizationisminimized.Theaimofthis book is to describe the themes and clarify the patterns that unify organic chemistry in future chapters. 6.1Kinds of Organic Reactions Organicchemicalreactionscanbeorganizedbroadlyintwoways—bywhatkindsofreactionsoccurandbyhow those reactions occur. Let’s look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions,andrearrangements. • Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms “left over.”Anexamplethatwe’llbestudyingsoonisthereactionofanalkene,suchasethylene,withHBrtoyield an alkyl bromide. • Eliminationreactions are,inasense,theoppositeofadditionreactions.Theyoccurwhenasinglereactant splitsintotwoproducts,oftenwiththeformationofasmallmoleculesuchaswaterorHBr.Anexampleis the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene. • Substitutionreactions occurwhentworeactantsexchangepartstogivetwonewproducts.Anexampleis thereactionofanestersuchasmethylacetatewithwatertoyieldacarboxylicacidplusanalcohol.Similar reactions occur in many biological pathways, including the metabolism of dietary fats. • Rearrangement reactionsoccur when a single reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to yield an isomeric product. An example is the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate into its constitutionalisomerglyceraldehyde3-phosphate,astepintheglycolysispathwaybywhichcarbohydrates are metabolized."}

A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation—which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds areformedandinwhatorder,andwhattherelativeratesareforeachstep.Acompletemechanismmustalso account for all reactants used and all products formed. All chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product moleculesareformed.Fundamentally,therearetwowaysinwhichacovalenttwo-electronbondcanbreak.A bondcanbreakinanelectronicallyunsymmetricalwaysothatbothbondingelectronsremainwithoneproduct fragment,leavingtheotherwithavacantorbital,orabondcanbreakinanelectronicallysymmetricalwayso that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to behomolytic. We’ll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement oftwo electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( ), whereas the movement ofone electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or “fishhook,” arrow ( ).

Processes that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are calledpolar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description. Processes that involve symmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are calledradical reactions. Aradical, oftencalleda freeradical,isaneutralchemicalspeciesthatcontainsanoddnumberofelectronsandthushas a single, unpaired electron in one of its orbitals. In addition to polar and radical reactions, there is a third, less commonly encountered process called a pericyclicreaction.

Mostorganiccompoundsareelectricallyneutral;theyhavenonetcharge,eitherpositiveornegative.Wesaw inSection 2.1,however,thatcertainbondswithinamolecule,particularlythebondsinfunctionalgroups,are polar. Bond polarity is a consequence of an unsymmetrical electron distribution in a bond and is due to the difference in electronegativity of the bonded atoms. Elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, and chlorine are more electronegative than carbon, so a carbon atom bonded to one of these atoms has a partial positive charge (δ+). Metals are less electronegative than carbon, so a carbon atom bonded to a metal has a partial negative charge (δ−). Electrostatic potential maps of chloromethane and methyllithium illustrate these charge distributions, showing that the carbon atom in chloromethane is electron-poor (blue) while the carbon in methyllithium is electron-rich (red). Thepolaritypatternsofsomecommonfunctionalgroupsareshownin TABLE 6.1.Notethatcarbonisalways positively polarized except when bonded to a metal.

The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon–sulfur and carbon–iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.

Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.

Anucleophileisasubstancethatis“nucleus-loving.”(Rememberthatanucleus is positively charged.) A nucleophile has a negatively polarized, electron-rich atom and can form a bond by donating a pair of electrons to a positively polarized, electron-poor atom. Nucleophiles can be either neutral or negatively charged; ammonia, water, hydroxide ion, and chloride ion are examples. Anelectrophile, by contrast, is “electron-loving.” An electrophile has a positively polarized, electron-poor atom and can form a bond by accepting a pair of electrons from a nucleophile. Electrophiles can be either neutral or positively charged. Acids (H+donors), alkyl halides, and carbonyl compounds are examples (FIGURE 6.2)."}

When ethylene is treated with HBr at room temperature, bromoethane is produced.

For example: Theelectrophilicsinkmustbeabletoacceptanelectronpair,usuallybecauseithaseitherapositivelycharged atom or a positively polarized atom in a functional group. For example: RULE 2 The nucleophile can be either negatively charged or neutral.If the nucleophile is negatively charged, the atom that donates an electron pair becomes neutral. For example: If the nucleophile is neutral, the atom that donates the electron pair acquires a positive charge. For example: RULE 3 Theelectrophilecanbeeitherpositivelychargedorneutral. Iftheelectrophileispositivelycharged,theatom bearing that charge becomes neutral after accepting an electron pair. For example: Iftheelectrophileisneutral,theatomthatultimatelyacceptstheelectronpairacquiresanegativecharge.For this to happen, however, the negative charge must be stabilized by being on an electronegative atom such as oxygen, nitrogen, or a halogen. Carbon and hydrogen do not typically stabilize a negative charge. For example: 6.5 • Using Curved Arrows in Polar Reaction Mechanisms 181"}

RULE 4 The octet rule must be followed.That is, no second-row atom can be left with ten electrons (or four for hydrogen). If an electron pair moves to an atom that already has an octet (or two electrons for hydrogen), another electron pair must simultaneously move from that atom to maintain the octet. When two electrons move from the bond of ethylene to the hydrogen atom of H3O+, for instance, two electrons must leave thathydrogen.ThismeansthattheH−Obondmustbreakandtheelectronsmuststaywiththeoxygen,giving neutral water.

The formation of the C−C bond involves donation of an electron pair from the nucleophilic carbon atom of the reactant on the left to the electrophilic carbon atom of CH3Br, so we draw a curved arrow originating from the lone pair on the negatively charged C atom and pointing to the C atom of CH3Br.AtthesametimethattheC−Cbondforms,theC−Brbondmustbreaksothattheoctetruleisnotviolated.

We’ll look at them in more detail inSections10.2 and10.3but will briefly see how they occur at this point. A radical is highly reactive because it contains an atom with an odd number of electrons (usually seven) in its valence shell, rather than a noble-gas octet. The radical can achieve a valence-shell octet in several ways however. For instance, it might abstract an atom and one bonding electron from another reactant, leaving behind a new radical. The net result is a radical substitution reaction. Alternatively, a reactant radical might add to a double bond, taking one electron from the double bond and yielding a new radical. The net result is a radical addition reaction. An example of an industrially useful radical reaction is the reaction of chlorine with methane to yield chloromethane,whichisusedtomanufacturethesolventsdichloromethane(CH 2Cl2)andchloroform(CHCl 3). The process begins with irradiation of Cl2 with ultraviolet light to break the relatively weak Cl−Cl bond of Cl2 and produce chlorine radicals (·Cl). 6.6 • Radical Reactions 183"}

When ΔG° is positive, the reaction isendergonic, has an unfavorable equilibrium constant, and cannot occur spontaneously.

In other words, exothermic reactions are favored by products with strong bonds and by reactants with weak, easily broken bonds. Sometimes, particularly in biochemistry, reactive substances that undergo highly exothermic reactions, such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate), are referred to as “energy-rich” or “high-energy” compounds. Such a label doesn’tmeanthatATPisspecialordifferentfromothercompounds,itonlymeansthatATPhasrelativelyweak bonds that require a relatively small amount of heat to break, thus leading to a larger release of heat when a strong new bond forms in a reaction.

A high activation energy results in a slow reaction because few collisions occur with enough energy for the reactants to reach the transition state. A low activation energy results in a rapid reaction because almost all collisions occur with enough energy for the reactants to reach the transition state.

As a rough generalization, many organic reactions have activation energies in the range 40 to 150 kJ/mol (10–35 kcal/mol). The reaction of ethylene with HBr, for example, has an activation energy of approximately temperature,whilereactionswithhigheractivationenergiesnormallyrequireahighertemperaturetogivethe reactants enough energy to climb the activation barrier. Once the transition state is reached, the reaction can either continue on to give the carbocation product or revert back to reactants.

Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between anucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and anelectrophilic(electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curvedarrowshowingthedirectionofelectrontravelfromthenucleophiletotheelectrophile.Radicalreactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one electron. The energy changes that take place during reactions can be described by considering both rates (how fast the reactions occur) and equilibria (how much the reactions occur). The position of a chemical equilibrium is determined by the value of thefree-energy change (Δ G) for the reaction, whereΔG = ΔH − TΔS. The enthalpyterm (ΔH) corresponds to the net change in strength of chemical bonds broken and formed during thereaction;the entropyterm(Δ S) correspondstothechangeintheamountofmolecularrandomnessduring the reaction.

FIGURE 7.2Compounds derived industrially from ethylene and propylene. Ethylene, propylene, and butene are synthesized from (C2–C8) alkanes by a process calledsteam crackingat temperatures up to 900 °C.\n\nThe cracking process is complex, although it undoubtedly involves radical reactions. The high-temperature reactionconditionscausespontaneousbreakingofC−CandC−Hbonds,withtheresultantformationofsmaller fragments.Wemightimagine,forinstance,thatamoleculeofbutanesplitsintotwoethylradicals,eachofwhich then loses a hydrogen atom to generate two molecules of ethylene. Steam cracking is an example of a reaction whose energetics are dominated by entropy (ΔS°) rather than by enthalpy (ΔH°) in the free-energy equationΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS° discussed inSection 6.7. Although the bond dissociation energyD for a carbon–carbon single bond is relatively high (about 370 kJ/mol) and cracking is endothermic, the large positive entropy change resulting from the fragmentation of one large molecule into several smaller pieces, together with the high temperature, makes the TΔS° term larger than theΔH° term, thereby favoring the cracking reaction. 7.2Calculating the Degree of Unsaturation Because of its double bond, an alkene has fewer hydrogens than an alkane with the same number of carbons—CnH2n for an alkene versus CnH2n+2 for an alkane—and is therefore referred to asunsaturated. Ethylene, for example, has the formula C2H4, whereas ethane has the formula C2H6. In general, each ring or double bond in a molecule corresponds to a loss of two hydrogens from the alkane formula C nH2n+2. Knowing this relationship, it’s possible to work backward from a molecular formula to calculate a molecule’sdegree of unsaturation—the number of rings and/or multiple bonds present in the molecule. Let’sassumethatwewanttofindthestructureofanunknownhydrocarbon.Amolecularweightdetermination yields a value of 82 amu, which corresponds to a molecular formula of C6H10.

For example, theformulaC 5H8OisequivalenttothehydrocarbonformulaC 5H8andthuscorrespondstotwodegreesof unsaturation. • Organonitrogencompounds(C,H,N) Nitrogen forms three bonds, so an organonitrogen compound has one more hydrogen than a related hydrocarbon. We therefore subtract the number of nitrogens from the number of hydrogens to arrive at the equivalent hydrocarbon formula. Again, you can convince yourself of this by seeing what happens when a nitrogen atom is inserted into an alkane bond: C−C becomes C−NH−C or C−H becomes C−NH2, meaning that one additional hydrogen atom has been added. We must thereforesubtractthisextrahydrogenatomtoarriveattheequivalenthydrocarbonformula.Forexample, the formula C5H9N is equivalent to C5H8and thus has two degrees of unsaturation. To summarize: • Addthe number ofhalogensto the number of hydrogens. • Ignorethe number ofoxygens. • Subtractthe number ofnitrogensfrom the number of hydrogens.

STEP 1 Name the parent hydrocarbon.Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond, and name the compound accordingly, using the suffix-ene: STEP 2 Number the carbon atoms in the chain.Begin at the end nearer the double bond or, if the double bond is equidistantfromthetwoends,beginattheendnearerthefirstbranchpoint.Thisruleensuresthatthedouble- bond carbons receive the lowest possible numbers. STEP 3 Write the full name.Number the substituents according to their positions in the chain, and list them alphabetically. Indicate the position of the double bond by giving the number of the first alkene carbon and placing that number directly before the parent name.

Although it’s sometimes possible to find relative stabilities of alkene isomers by establishing a cis–trans equilibrium through treatment with strong acid, a more general method is to take advantage of the fact that alkenes undergo a hydrogenationreaction to give the corresponding alkane when treated with H2 gas in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium or platinum.

The cis isomer is higher in energy than the trans isomer by about 2.8 kJ/mol and therefore releases more energy when hydrogenated. If we were to measure the so-called heats of hydrogenation (ΔH°hydrog) for two double-bond isomers and find their difference, we could determine the relative stabilities of cis and trans isomers without having to measure an equilibrium position.cis-2-Butene, for instance, hasΔH°hydrog = −119 kJ/mol(−28.3 kcal/mol), whiletrans-2-butene has ΔH°hydrog= −115 kJ/mol(−27.4 kcal/mol)—a difference of 4 kJ/mol. The4kJ/molenergydifferencebetweenthe2-buteneisomerscalculatedfromheatsofhydrogenationagrees reasonably well with the 2.8 kJ/mol energy difference calculated from equilibrium data, but the values aren’t exactly the same for two reasons. First, there is probably some experimental error, because heats of hydrogenation are difficult to measure accurately. Second, heats of reaction and equilibrium constants don’t measure exactly the same thing. Heats of reaction measure enthalpy changes,Δ H°, whereas equilibrium constants measure free-energy changes, ΔG°, so we might expect a slight difference between the two.

Because carbocations are involved as intermediates in these electrophilic addition reactions, Markovnikov’s rule can be restated in the following way: Markovnikov’s rulerestated In the addition of HX to an alkene, the more highly substituted carbocation is formed as the intermediate rather than the less highly substituted one. For example, addition of H+ to 2-methylpropene yields the intermediate tertiary carbocation rather than the alternative primary carbocation, and addition to 1-methylcyclohexene yields a tertiary cation rather than a secondary one.

(a) (b) (c) (d) 7.8 • Orientation of Electrophilic Additions: Markovnikov’s Rule 225\n\n7.9Carbocation Structure and Stability To understand why Markovnikov’s rule works, we need to learn more about the structure and stability of carbocationsandaboutthegeneralnatureofreactionsandtransitionstates.Thefirstpointtoexploreinvolves structure. A great deal of experimental evidence has shown that carbocations are planar. The trivalent carbon is sp2-hybridized, and the three substituents are oriented toward the corners of an equilateral triangle, as indicated inFIGURE 7.10. Because there are only six valence electrons on carbon and all six are used in the threeσ bonds, theporbital extending above and below the plane is unoccupied. FIGURE 7.10The structure of a carbocation.Thetrivalentcarbonissp2-hybridized andhasavacant porbital perpendiculartotheplaneof the carbon and three attached groups. The second point to explore involves carbocation stability. 2-Methylpropene might react with H+ to form a carbocation having three alkyl substituents (a tertiary ion, 3°), or it might react to form a carbocation having onealkylsubstituent(aprimaryion,1°).Sincethetertiaryalkylchloride,2-chloro-2-methylpropane,istheonly product observed, formation of the tertiary cation is evidently favored over formation of the primary cation. Thermodynamic measurements show that, indeed, the stability of carbocations increases with increasing substitution so that the stability order is tertiary > secondary > primary > methyl. One way of determining carbocation stabilities is to measure the amount of energy required to form a carbocation by dissociation of the corresponding alkyl halide, R − X → R+ + :X−. As shown inFIGURE 7.11, tertiary alkyl halides dissociate to give carbocations more easily than secondary or primary ones. Thus, trisubstituted carbocations are more stable than disubstituted ones, which are more stable than monosubstituted ones. The data inFIGURE 7.11 are taken from measurements made in the gas phase, but a similar stability order is found for carbocations in solution. The dissociation enthalpies are much lower in solution because polar solvents can stabilize the ions, but the order of carbocation stability remains the same."}

More highly substituted alkyl halides dissociate more easily than less highly substituted ones. Whyaremorehighlysubstitutedcarbocationsmorestablethanlesshighlysubstitutedones?Thereareatleast two reasons. Part of the answer has to do with inductive effects, and part has to do with hyperconjugation. Inductiveeffects,discussedin Section 2.1 inconnectionwithpolarcovalentbonds,resultfromtheshiftingof electrons in aσ bond in response to the electronegativity of nearby atoms. In the present instance, electrons fromarelativelylargerandmorepolarizablealkylgroupcanshifttowardaneighboringpositivechargemore easilythantheelectronfromahydrogen.Thus,themorealkylgroupsattachedtothepositivelychargedcarbon, the more electron density shifts toward the charge and the more inductive stabilization of the cation occurs (FIGURE 7.12).

Thatis,thestabilityorderof carbocations is tertiary > secondary > primary > methyl. What we have not yet seen is how these two points are related. Why does the stability of the carbocation intermediateaffecttherateatwhichit’sformedandtherebydeterminethestructureofthefinalproduct?After all,carbocationstabilityisdeterminedbythefree-energychange Δ G°, butreactionrateisdeterminedbythe activation energy ΔG‡. The two quantities aren’t directly related. Although there is no simple quantitative relationship between the stability of a carbocation intermediate and the rate of its formation, thereis an intuitive relationship. It’s generally true when comparing two similar reactions that the more stable intermediate forms faster than the less stable one. The situation is shown graphicallyin FIGURE 7.14,wheretheenergyprofileinpart (a)representsthetypicalsituation,asopposedto the profile in part(b).

FIGURE 7.15 Energy diagrams for endergonic and exergonic steps.(a) In an endergonic step, the energy levels of transition state and productare closer.(b) In an exergonic step, the energy levels of transition state andreactantare closer. In anendergonicreaction(FIGURE 7.15a),theenergylevelofthetransitionstateisclosertothatoftheproduct thanthatofthereactant.Sincethetransitionstateiscloserenergeticallytotheproduct,wemakethenatural assumption that it’s also closer structurally. In other words, the transition state for an endergonic reaction stepstructurallyresemblestheproductofthatstep.Conversely,thetransitionstateforanexergonicreaction (FIGURE 7.15b),iscloserenergetically,andthusstructurally,tothereactantthantotheproduct.Wetherefore say that the transition state for an exergonic reaction step structurally resembles the reactant for that step. Hammond postulate: The structure of a transition state resembles the structure of the nearest stable species. Transition states for endergonic steps structurally resemble products, and transition states for exergonic steps structurally resemble reactants. HowdoestheHammondpostulateapplytoelectrophilicadditionreactions?Theformationofacarbocationby protonation of an alkene is an endergonic step. Thus, the transition state for alkene protonation structurally resembles the carbocation intermediate, and any factor that stabilizes the carbocation will also stabilize the nearby transition state. Since increasing alkyl substitution stabilizes carbocations, it also stabilizes the transition states leading to those ions, thus resulting in a faster reaction.

For example, when 1-methylcyclohexanol is warmed with aqueous sulfuric acid in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent, loss of water occurs and 1-methylcyclohexene is formed. In biological pathways, dehydrations rarely occur with isolated alcohols. Instead, they normally take place on substrates in which the −OH is positioned two carbons away from a group. In the biosynthesis of fats, for instance,β-hydroxybutyryl ACP is converted by dehydration totrans-crotonyl ACP, where ACP is an abbreviation foracyl carrier protein.We’ll see the reason for this requirement inSection 11.10.

Although this mechanism seems plausible, it’s not fully consistent with known facts. In particular, it doesn’t explainthestereochemistryoftheadditionreaction.Thatis,themechanismdoesn’taccountforwhichproduct stereoisomer is formed. When the halogenation reaction is carried out on a cycloalkene, such as cyclopentene, only the trans stereoisomer of the dihalide addition product is formed, rather than the mixture of cis and trans isomers that might have been expected if a planar carbocation intermediate were involved. We say that the reaction occurswith antistereochemistry,meaningthatthetwobromineatomscomefromoppositefacesofthedouble bond—one from the top face and one from the bottom face. An explanation for the observed stereochemistry of addition was suggested in 1937 by George Kimball and IrvingRoberts,whoproposedthatthereactionintermediateisnotacarbocationbutisinsteada bromonium ion, , formed by electrophilic addition of Br+ to the alkene. (Similarly, a chloronium ion contains a positivelycharged,divalentchlorine,R 2Cl+.)Thebromoniumionisformedinasinglestepbyinteractionofthe alkene with Br2and the simultaneous loss of Br−.

When it comes to circumventing problems like those with acid-catalyzed alkene hydrations, laboratory chemists have a great advantage over the cellular “chemists” in living organisms. Laboratory chemists are not constrained to carry out their reactions in water solution; they can choose from any of a large number of solvents. Laboratory reactions don’t need to be carried out at a fixed temperature; they can take place over a widerangeoftemperatures.Andlaboratoryreagentsaren’tlimitedtocontainingcarbon,oxygen,nitrogen,and a few other elements; they can contain any element in the periodic table. In the laboratory, alkenes are often hydrated by theoxymercuration–demercuration procedure, which involves electrophilic addition of Hg2+ to the alkene on reaction with mercury(II) acetate [(CH3CO2)2Hg. The intermediateorganomercurycompoundisthentreatedwithsodiumborohydride,NaBH 4,anddemercuration occurs to produce an alcohol.

Nucleophilic addition of water as in halohydrin formation, followedbythelossofaproton,thenyieldsastableorganomercuryproduct.Thefinalstep,demercurationof the organomercury compound by reaction with sodium borohydride, is complex and involves radicals. Note that the regiochemistry of the reaction corresponds to Markovnikov addition of water; that is, the −OH group attachestothemorehighlysubstitutedcarbonatom,andthe−Hattachestothelesshighlysubstitutedcarbon. The hydrogen that replaces mercury in the demercuration step can attach from either side of the molecule depending on the exact circumstances. FIGURE 8.5 Mechanism of the oxymercuration of an alkene to yield an alcohol.(1) Electrophilic addition of Hg2+ gives a mercurinium ion, which (2) reacts with water as in halohydrin formation. Loss of a proton gives an organomercury product, and (3) reaction with NaBH4 removes the mercury.

Discovered in 1959 by H.C. BrownatPurdueUniversityandcalled hydroboration,thereactioninvolvesadditionofaB−Hbondofborane, BH3,toanalkenetoyieldanorganoboraneintermediate,RBH 2.Oxidationoftheorganoboranebyreactionwith basic hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, then gives an alcohol. For example: BoraneisveryreactiveasaLewisacidbecausetheboronatomhasonlysixelectronsinitsvalenceshellrather than an octet. In tetrahydrofuran solution, BH3 accepts an electron pair from a solvent molecule in a Lewis acid–base reaction to complete its octet and form a stable BH3–THF complex. When an alkene reacts with BH3 in THF solution, rapid addition to the double bond occurs three times and a trialkylborane, R3B, is formed. For example, 1 molar equivalent of BH3 adds to 3 molar equivalents of cyclohexene to yield tricyclohexylborane. When tricyclohexylborane is then treated with aqueous hydrogen H2O2 in basic solution, an oxidation takes place. The three C−B bonds are broken, −OH groups bond to the three carbons, and 3 equivalents of cyclohexanol are produced. The net effect of the two-step hydroboration–oxidation sequence is hydration of the alkene double bond.

We describe the result by saying that the double bond has been hydrogenated, orreduced. N ote that the wordreduction is use d somewhat differently in organic chemistry from what you might have learned previously. In general chemistry, a reduction is defined as the gain of one or more electrons by an atom. In organic chemistry, however, areduction is a reaction that results in a gain of electron density for carbon, caused either by bond formation between carbon and a less electronegative atom—usually hydrogen—or by bond-breaking between carbon and a more electronegative atom—usually oxygen, nitrogen, or a halogen. We’ll explore this topic in more detail inSection 10.8. Platinum and palladium are the most common laboratory catalysts for alkene hydrogenations. Palladium is normally used as a very fine powder “supported” on an inert material such as charcoal (Pd/C) to maximize surfacearea.PlatinumisnormallyusedasPtO 2,areagentknownas Adams’catalyst afterits discoverer,Roger Adams at the University of Illinois. Catalytic hydrogenation, unlike most other organic reactions, is aheterogeneous process ra ther than a homogeneousone.Thatis,thehydrogenationreactiondoesnotoccurinahomogeneoussolutionbutinstead takes place on the surface of solid catalyst particles. Hydrogenation usually occurs with syn stereochemistry: both hydrogens add to the double bond from the same face.

Reduction therefore occurs exclusively from the bottom face to yield the product shown.\n\nAlkenes are much more reactive toward catalytic hydrogenation than most other unsaturated functional groups, and the reaction is therefore quite selective. Other functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles, often survive alkene hydrogenation conditions unchanged, although reaction with these groups does occur under more vigorous conditions. Note that, particularly in the hydrogenation of methyl 3-phenylpropenoateshownbelow,thearomaticringisnotreducedbyhydrogenandpalladiumeventhoughit contains apparent double bonds.

As we’ll see inSection 27.1, vegetable oils are triesters of glycerol, HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH, with three long-chain carboxylic acids called fatty acids. The fatty acids are generally polyunsaturated, and their double bonds have cis stereochemistry. Complete hydrogenation yields the corresponding saturated fatty acids, but incomplete hydrogenation often results in partial cis–trans isomerization of a remaining double bond. When eaten and digested, the free trans fatty acids are released, raising blood cholesterol levels and potentially contributing to coronary problems. 8.6 • Reduction of Alkenes: Hydrogenation 257"}

Ozone(O3)isperhapsthemostusefuldouble-bondcleavagereagent.Preparedbypassingastreamofoxygen through a high-voltage electrical discharge, ozone adds rapidly to a bond at low temperature to give a cyclic intermediate called amolozonide. Once formed, the molozonide spontaneously rearranges to form an ozonide. Although we won’t study the mechanism of this rearrangement in detail, it involves the molozonide coming apart into two fragments that then recombine in a different way. Low-molecular-weight ozonides are explosive and therefore not isolated. Instead, the ozonide is immediately treatedwithareducingagent,suchaszincmetalinaceticacid,toproducecarbonylcompounds.Thenetresult of the ozonolysis/reduction sequence is that the bond is cleaved and an oxygen atom becomes doubly bonded to each of the original alkene carbons.

Ethylene, for example, yields polyethylene, an enormous alkane that may have a molecular weight up to 6 millionu and may contain as many as 200,000 monomer units. Worldwide production of polyethylene is approximately 88 million tons per year. Polyethylene and other simple alkene polymers are calledchain-growth polymersbecause they are formed in a chain-reaction process in which an initiator adds to a carbon–carbon double bond to yield a reactive intermediate. The intermediate then reacts with a second molecule of monomer to yield a new intermediate, which reacts with a third monomer unit, and so on. Historically,ethylenepolymerizationwascarriedoutathighpressure(1000–3000atm)andhightemperature (100–250 °C) in the presence of a radical initiator such as benzoyl peroxide.

Put another way, optical activity can’t appear from nowhere; an optically active product can only result by starting with an optically active reactant or chiral environment (Section 5.12). In contrast to laboratory reactions, enzyme-catalyzed biological reactions often give a single enantiomer of a chiral product, even when the substrate is achiral. One step in the citric acid cycle of food metabolism, for instance, is the aconitase-catalyzed addition of water to ( Z)-aconitate(usually called cis-aconitate)to give isocitrate. Even thoughcis-aconitate is achiral, only the (2R,3S) enantiomer of the product is formed.

For example, what stereochemical result would be obtainedfromadditionofH 2Otoachiralalkene,suchas( R)-4-methyl-1-hexene? Theproductofthereaction, 4-methyl-2-hexanol, has two chirality centers and so has four possible stereoisomers. Let’s think about the two chirality centers separately. What about the configuration at C4, the methyl-bearing carbonatom?SinceC4hasthe Rconfiguration inthestartingmaterialandthischiralitycenterisunaffectedby thereaction,itsconfigurationisunchanged.Thus,theconfigurationatC4intheproductremains R(assuming that the relative rankings of the four attached groups are not changed by the reaction).

But this carbocation doesn’t have a plane of symmetry; it is chiral because of the chirality center at C4. Because the carbocation is chiral and has no plane of symmetry, it doesn’t react equally well from the top and bottom faces. One of the two faces is likely, for steric reasons, to be a bit more accessible than the other, leadingtoamixtureof RandSproducts insomeratiootherthan50:50.Thus,twodiastereomericproducts, (2R,4R)-4-methyl-2-hexanol and(2S,4R)-4-methyl-2-hexanol, areformedinunequalamounts,andthemixture is optically active.

A mixture of diastereomeric 2R,4R and 2S,4R products is formed in unequal amounts because reaction of the chiral carbocation intermediate is not equally likely from top and bottom. The product mixture is optically active. As a general rule, the formation of a new chirality center by a chiral reactant leads to unequal amounts of diastereomeric products. If the chiral reactant is optically active because only one enantiomer is used rather than a racemic mixture, then the products are also optically active.

The triterpenoid lanosterol, for instance, is the biological precursor from which all steroid hormones are made. Isoprene itself is not the true biological precursor of terpenoids. Nature instead uses two “isoprene equivalents”—isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate—which are themselves made by two different routes depending on the organism. Lanosterol, in particular, is biosynthesized from acetic acid by a complex pathway that has been worked out in great detail. We’ll look at the subject more closely inSections 27.5and27.7.

Alkenesaregenerallypreparedbyaneliminationreaction,suchasdehydrohalogenation,theeliminationofHX fromanalkylhalide,ordehydration,theeliminationofwaterfromanalcohol.Theconverseofthiselimination reaction is the addition of various substances to the alkene double bond to give saturated products.

Initial reaction of the nucleophilicdoublebondwithH +givesacarbocationintermediate,whichthenreactswithhalideion.Bromine andchlorineaddtoalkenesviathree-membered-ring bromoniumion orchloroniumionintermediatestogive addition products havinganti stereochemistry. If water is present during the halogen addition reaction, a halohydrinis formed. Hydration of an alkene—the addition of water—is carried out by either of two procedures, depending on the product desired. Oxymercuration–demercuration involves electrophilic addition of Hg2+ to an alkene, followed by trapping of the cation intermediate with water and subsequent treatment with NaBH 4. Hydroboration involves addition of borane (BH3) followed by oxidation of the intermediate organoborane withalkalineH 2O2.Thetwohydrationmethodsarecomplementary:oxymercuration–demercurationgivesthe product of Markovnikov addition, whereas hydroboration–oxidation gives the product with non-Markovnikov syn stereochemistry. Alkenes arereduced by addition of H2 in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum or palladium to yield alkanes,aprocesscalledcatalytic hydrogenation.Alkenesarealso oxidizedbyreactionwithaperoxyacidto give epoxides, which can be converted into trans-1,2-diols by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The corresponding cis-1,2-diols can be made directly from alkenes byhydroxylation with OsO4. Alkenes can also be cleaved to produce carbonyl compounds by reaction with ozone, followed by reduction with zinc metal. In addition, alkenes react with divalent substances called carbenes, R2C:, to give cyclopropanes.

Draw and name them. 9.2Preparation of Alkynes: Elimination Reactions of Dihalides AlkynescanbepreparedbytheeliminationofHXfromalkylhalidesinasimilarmannerasalkenes(Section 8.1).Treatmentofa1,2-dihaloalkane(calleda vicinaldihalide) withanexcessamountofastrongbasesuchas KOHorNaNH 2resultsinatwofoldeliminationofHXandformationofanalkyne.AswiththeeliminationofHX toformanalkene,we’lldeferafulldiscussionofthistopicandtherelevantreactionmechanismstoChapter11. The starting vicinal dihalides are themselves readily available by addition of Br2 or Cl2 to alkenes. Thus, the overall halogenation/dehydrohalogenation sequence makes it possible to go from an alkene to an alkyne. For example, diphenylethylene is converted into diphenylacetylene by reaction with Br2 and subsequent base treatment. Thetwofolddehydrohalogenationtakesplacethroughavinylichalideintermediate,whichsuggeststhatvinylic halides themselves should give alkynes when treated with strong base. (A vinylic substituent is one that is attached to a double-bond.) This is indeed the case. For example: 9.3Reactions of Alkynes: Addition of HX and X2 You might recall fromSection 1.9 that a carbon–carbon triple bond results from the interaction of two sp-hybridized carbonatoms.Thetwo sphybrid orbitalsofcarbonlieatanangleof180°toeachotheralongan axisperpendiculartotheaxesofthetwounhybridized2 py and 2pz orbitals. Whentwo sp-hybridized carbons approacheachother,one sp–spσ bond andtwo p–pπ bonds areformed.Thetworemaining sporbitals form bonds to other atoms at an angle of 180° from the carbon–carbon bond. Thus, acetylene is a linear molecule with bond angles of 180° (FIGURE 9.2). The length of the bond is 120 pm, and its strength is approximately 965 kJ/mol (231 kcal/mol), making it the shortest and strongest known carbon–carbon bond. 9.2 • Preparation of Alkynes: Elimination Reactions of Dihalides 289"}

As the following examples indicate, the regiochemistry of additionfollowsMarkovnikov’srule,withhalogenaddingtothemorehighlysubstitutedsideofthealkynebond andhydrogenaddingtothelesshighlysubstitutedside.TransstereochemistryofHandXnormally,although not always, occurs in the product. Bromine and chlorine also add to alkynes to give addition products, and trans stereochemistry again results. Themechanismofalkyneadditionissimilarbutnotidenticaltothatofalkeneaddition.Whenanelectrophile such as HBr adds to an alkene, the reaction takes place in two steps and involves an alkyl carbocation intermediate (Section 7.7 and Section 7.8). If HBr were to add by the same mechanism to an alkyne, an analogous vinylic carbocation would be formed as the intermediate.\n\nA vinylic carbocation has ansp-hybridized carbon and generally forms less readily than an alkyl carbocation (FIGURE 9.3).Asarule,asecondaryvinyliccarbocationformsaboutasreadilyasaprimaryalkylcarbocation, butaprimaryvinyliccarbocationissodifficulttoformthatthereisnoclearevidenceitevenexists.Thus,many alkyne additions occur through more complex mechanistic pathways.

As shown inFIGURE 9.4, the mechanism of the mercury(II)-catalyzed alkyne hydration reaction is analogous totheoxymercurationreactionofalkenes(Section 8.4).Electrophilicadditionofmercury(II)iontothealkyne gives a vinylic cation, which reacts with water and loses a proton to yield a mercury-containing enol intermediate. In contrast with alkene oxymercuration, however, no treatment with NaBH4 is necessary to remove the mercury. The acidic reaction conditions alone are sufficient to effect replacement of mercury by hydrogen.

Trans stereochemistry of the alkene product is established during the second reduction step (3) when the less-hindered trans vinylic anion is formed from the vinylic radical. Vinylic radicals undergo rapid cis–trans equilibration, but vinylic anions equilibrate much less rapidly. Thus, the more stable trans vinylic anion is formed rather than the less stable cis anion and is then protonated without equilibration.

More than one step is needed. Strategy When undertaking any synthesis problem, you should look at the product, identify the functional groups it contains,andthenaskyourselfhowthosefunctionalgroupscanbeprepared.Alwaysworkretrosynthetically, one step at a time. Theproductinthiscaseisacis-disubstitutedalkene,sothefirstquestionis,“Whatisanimmediateprecursor of a cis-disubstituted alkene?” We know that an alkene can be prepared from an alkyne by reduction and that the right choice of experimental conditions will allow us to prepare either a trans-disubstituted alkene (usinglithiuminliquidammonia)oracis-disubstitutedalkene(usingcatalytichydrogenationovertheLindlar catalyst). Thus, reduction of 2-hexyne by catalytic hydrogenation using the Lindlar catalyst should yield cis-2-hexene. Nextask,“Whatisanimmediateprecursorof2-hexyne?”We’veseenthataninternalalkynecanbeprepared byalkylationofaterminalalkyneanion.Inthepresentinstance,we’retoldtostartwith1-pentyneandanalkyl halide. Thus, alkylation of the anion of 1-pentyne with iodomethane should yield 2-hexyne. Solution cis-2-Hexene can be synthesized from the given starting materials in three steps.

Nowthatwe’vecoveredthechemistryofhydrocarbons,it’stimetostartlookingatmorecomplexsubstances that contain elements in addition to C and H. We’ll begin by discussing the chemistry oforganohalides, compounds that contain one or more halogen atoms. Halogen-substituted organic compounds are widespread in nature, and more than 5000 organohalides have been found in algae and various other marine organisms. Chloromethane, for instance, is released in large amountsbyoceankelp,aswellasbyforestfiresandvolcanoes.Halogen-containingcompoundsalsohavean arrayofindustrialapplications,includingtheiruseassolvents,inhaledanestheticsinmedicine,refrigerants, and pesticides. Stillotherhalo-substitutedcompoundsareusedasmedicinesandfoodadditives.Thenonnutritivesweetener sucralose, marketed as Splenda, contains three chlorine atoms, for instance. Sucralose is about 600 times as sweet as sucrose, so only 1 mg is equivalent to an entire teaspoon of table sugar. A large variety of organohalides are known. The halogen might be bonded to an alkynyl group (), a vinylicgroup( ),anaromaticring(Ar−X),oranalkylgroup.Inthischapter,however,we’llbeprimarily concernedwith alkylhalides,compoundswithahalogenatombondedtoasaturated, sp3-hybridized carbon atom. 10.1Names and Structures of Alkyl Halides Althoughcommonlycalled alkylhalides, halogen-substitutedalkanesarenamedsystematicallyas haloalkanes (Section 3.4), treating the halogen as a substituent on a parent alkane chain. There are three steps: STEP 1 Find thelongestchain,andnameitastheparent. Ifadoubleortriplebondispresent,theparentchainmust contain it. STEP 2 Numberthecarbonsoftheparentchainbeginningattheendnearerthefirstsubstituent,whetheralkylor halo.Assign each substituent a number according to its position on the chain.

Fromtheseandsimilarreactions,it’spossibletocalculateareactivityordertowardchlorinationfordifferent kinds of hydrogen atoms in a molecule. Take the butane chlorination, for instance. Butane has six equivalent primaryhydrogens(−CH 3)andfourequivalentsecondaryhydrogens(−CH 2−).Thefactthatbutaneyields30% of1-chlorobutaneproductmeansthateachoneofthesixprimaryhydrogensisresponsiblefor30%÷6=5% oftheproduct.Similarly,thefactthat70%of2-chlorobutaneisformedmeansthateachofthefoursecondary hydrogensisresponsiblefor70%÷4=17.5%oftheproduct.Thus,asecondaryhydrogenreacts17.5%÷5%= 3.5 times as often as a primary hydrogen. Asimilarcalculationforthechlorinationof2-methylpropaneindicatesthateachofthenineprimaryhydrogens accounts for 65% ÷ 9 = 7.2% of the product, while the single tertiary hydrogen (R3CH) accounts for 35% of the product.

What would the approximate percentage of each product be? (Don’t forget to take into account the number of each kind of hydrogen.) 10.3Preparing Alkyl Halides from Alkenes: Allylic Bromination We’ve already seen several methods for preparing alkyl halides from alkenes, including the reactions of HX andX2withalkenesinelectrophilicadditionreactions(Section 7.7 andSection 8.2).ThehydrogenhalidesHCl, HBr,andHIreactwithalkenesbyapolarmechanismtogivetheproductofMarkovnikovaddition.Bromineand chlorine undergo anti addition through halonium ion intermediates to give 1,2-dihalogenated products. Anotherlaboratorymethodforpreparingalkylhalidesfromalkenesisbyreactionwith N-bromosuccinimide (abbreviated NBS),inthepresenceofultravioletlight,togiveproductsresultingfromsubstitutionofhydrogen by bromine at the position next to the double bond—theallylic position. Cyclohexene, for example, gives 3-bromocyclohexene. This allylic bromination with NBS is analogous to the alkane chlorination reaction discussed in the previous sectionandoccursbyaradicalchain-reactionpathway(FIGURE 10.3).Asinalkanehalogenation,aBr· radical abstractsanallylichydrogenatom,forminganallylicradicalplusHBr.TheHBrthenreactswithNBStoform Br2, which in turn reacts with the allylic radical to yield the brominated product and a Br·radical that cycles back into the first step and carries on the chain.\n\nFIGURE 10.3 Mechanism of allylic bromination of an alkene with NBS.The process is a radical chain reaction in which (1) a Br·radical abstractsanallylichydrogenatomofthealkeneandgivesanallylicradicalplusHBr.(2)TheHBrthenreactswithNBStoformBr 2,which(3) reacts with the allylic radical to yield the bromoalkene product and a Br· radical that continues the chain. WhydoesbrominationwithNBSoccurexclusivelyatanallylicpositionratherthanelsewhereinthemolecule? Theanswer,onceagain,isfoundbylookingatbonddissociationenergiestoseetherelativestabilitiesofvarious kindsofradicals.AlthoughatypicalsecondaryalkylC−Hbondhasastrengthofabout410kJ/mol(98kcal/mol) andatypicalvinylicC−Hbondhasastrengthof465kJ/mol(111kcal/mol),anallylicC−Hbondhasastrengthof onlyabout370kJ/mol(88kcal/mol).Anallylicradicalisthereforemorestablethanatypicalalkylradicalwith the same substitution by about 40 kJ/mol (9 kcal/mol). We can thus expand the stability ordering to include vinylic and allylic radicals. 10.4Stability of the Allyl Radical: Resonance Revisited To see why an allylic radical is so stable, look at the orbital picture inFIGURE 10.4.

Because the allyl radical is electronically symmetrical, it has two resonance forms—one with the unpaired electronontheleftandthedoublebondontherightandanotherwiththeunpairedelectronontherightandthe doublebondontheleft.Neitherstructureiscorrectbyitself;thetruestructureoftheallylradicalisaresonance hybrid of the two. (You might want to reviewSection 2.4 to Section 2.6 to brush up on resonance.) As noted in Section 2.5, the greater the number of resonance forms, the greater the stability of a compound, because bonding electrons are attracted to more nuclei. An allyl radical, with two resonance forms, is therefore more stable than a typical alkyl radical, which has only a single structure. In molecular orbital terms, the stability of the allyl radical is due to the fact that the unpaired electron is delocalized,orspreadout,overanextended π-orbital networkratherthanlocalizedatonlyonesite,asshown by the computer-generated MO inFIGURE 10.4. This delocalization is particularly apparent in the so-called spin-density surface inFIGURE 10.5, which shows the calculated location of the unpaired electron. The two terminal carbons share the unpaired electron equally. FIGURE 10.5 The spin density surface of the allyl radical locates the position of theunpaired electron and shows that it is equally shared between the two terminal carbons. Inadditiontoitseffectonstability,delocalizationoftheunpairedelectronintheallylradicalhasotherchemical consequences. Because the unpaired electron is delocalized over both ends of theπ orbital system, reaction with Br2 can occur at either end. As a result, allylic bromination of an unsymmetrical alkene often leads to a mixture of products. For example, bromination of 1-octene gives a mixture of 3-bromo-1-octene and 1-bromo-2-octene. The two products are not formed in equal amounts, however, because the intermediate allylicradicalisnotsymmetricalandreactionatthetwoendsisnotequallylikely.Reactionatthelesshindered, primary end is favored."}

It was simply assumedthatchloroform,halogenatedphenols,chlorinatedaromaticcompoundscalledPCBs,andothersuch substancesfoundintheenvironmentwereindustrialpollutants.Now,lessthanhalfacenturylater,thesituation is quite different. More than 5000 organohalides have been found to occur naturally, and tens of thousands moresurelyexist.Fromasimplecompoundlikechloromethanetoanextremelycomplexoneliketheantibiotic vancomycin, a remarkably diverse range of organohalides exists in plants, bacteria, and animals. Many even have valuable physiological activity. The pentahalogenated alkene halomon, for instance, has been isolated fromtheredalga Portieriahornemannii and foundtohaveanticanceractivityagainstseveralhumantumorcell lines. Some naturally occurring organohalides are produced in massive quantities.

Why do organisms produce organohalides, many of which are undoubtedly toxic? The answer seems to be that many organisms use organohalogen compounds for self-defense, either as feeding deterrents, irritants to predators, or natural pesticides. Marine sponges, coral, and sea hares, for example, release foul-tasting organohalides that deter fish, starfish, and other predators. Even humans appear to produce halogenated compounds as part of their defense against infection. The human immune system contains a peroxidase enzymecapableofcarryingouthalogenationreactionsonfungiandbacteria,therebykillingthepathogen.And most remarkable of all, even free chlorine—Cl2—has been found to be present in humans.

Alkyl halides react with magnesium in ether solution to form organomagnesium halides, called Grignard reagents (RMgX), which are both nucleophilic and strongly basic. Alkyl halides also react with lithium metal to form organolithium reagents, RLi. In the presence of CuI, these form diorganocoppers, orGilman reagents (LiR2Cu). Gilman reagents react with organohalides to yield coupled hydrocarbon products.

Walden found that the pure enantiomeric (+)- and (–)-malic acids could be interconvertedthroughaseriesofsimplesubstitutionreactions.WhenWaldentreated(–)-malicacidwithPCl 5, heisolated(+)-chlorosuccinicacid.This,ontreatmentwithwetAg 2O,gave(+)-malicacid.Similarly,reactionof (+)-malicacidwithPCl 5gave(–)-chlorosuccinicacid,whichwasconvertedinto(–)-malicacidwhentreatedwith wet Ag2O. The full cycle of reactions is shown inFIGURE 11.2. FIGURE 11.2Walden’s cycle of reactions interconverting (+)- and (–)-malic acids. At the time, the results were astonishing. The eminent chemist Emil Fischer called Walden’s discovery “the most remarkable observation made in the field of optical activity since the fundamental observations of Pasteur.” Because (–)-malic acid was converted into (+)-malic acid, some reactions in the cycle must have occurred with a change, or inversion, of configuration at the chirality center. But which ones, and how?

The process is shown inFIGURE 11.4 for the reaction of (S)-2-bromobutane with HO– to give (R)-2-butanol.

ThemechanismproposedbyHughesandIngoldisfullyconsistentwithexperimentalresults,explainingboth stereochemical and kinetic data. Thus, the requirement for a backside approach of the entering nucleophile (180° away from the departing X group) causes the stereochemistry of the substrate to invert, much like an umbrella turning inside-out in the wind.

Some SN2 reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let’s begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general. The rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy ∆ G‡, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect ∆G‡ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raisingthetransition-stateenergyincreases∆ G‡and decreasesthereactionrate;raisingthereactantenergyor"}

(a)Ahigherreactantenergylevel(red curve)correspondstoafasterreaction(smaller∆ G‡).(b) A highertransition-stateenergylevel(redcurve)correspondstoaslowerreaction (larger ∆G‡). Steric Effects in the SN2 Reaction The first SN2 reaction variable to look at is the structure of the substrate. Because the SN2 transition state involvespartialbondformationbetweentheincomingnucleophileandthealkylhalidecarbonatom,itseems reasonable that a hindered, bulky substrate should prevent easy approach of the nucleophile, making bond formation difficult. In other words, the transition state for reaction of a sterically hindered substrate, whose carbonatomis“shielded”fromtheapproachoftheincomingnucleophile,ishigherinenergyandformsmore slowly than the corresponding transition state for a less hindered substrate (FIGURE 11.7). FIGURE 11.7 Steric hindrance to the SN2 reaction.As the models indicate, the carbon atom in(a) bromomethane is readily accessible, resulting in a fast S N2 reaction. The carbon atoms in (b) bromoethane (primary), (c) 2-bromopropane (secondary), and (d) 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tertiary) are successively more hindered, resulting in successively slower SN2 reactions. As FIGURE 11.7 shows, the difficulty of nucleophile approach increases as the three substituents bonded to the halo-substituted carbon atom increase in size. Methyl halides are by far the most reactive substrates in SN2 reactions, followed by primary alkyl halides such as ethyl and propyl. Alkyl branching at the reacting center, as in isopropyl halides (2°), slows the reaction greatly, and further branching, as intert-butyl halides (3°), effectively halts the reaction. Even branching one carbon away from the reacting center, as in 2,2-dimethylpropyl (neopentyl)halides, greatly hinders nucleophilic displacement. As a result, SN2 reactions occuronlyatrelativelyunhinderedsitesandarenormallyusefulonlywithmethylhalides,primaryhalides,and a few simple secondary halides.

Detailed explanations for the observed nucleophilicities aren’t always simple, but some trends can be detected from the data ofTABLE 11.1. • Nucleophilicity roughly parallels basicitywhen comparing nucleophiles that have the same reacting atom.Thus,OH –isbothmorebasicandmorenucleophilicthanacetateion,CH 3CO2–,whichinturnismore basic and more nucleophilic than H2O. Since “nucleophilicity” is usually taken as the affinity of a Lewis baseforacarbonatomintheS N2reactionand“basicity”istheaffinityofabaseforaproton,it’seasytosee why there might be a correlation between the two kinds of behavior. • Nucleophilicity usually increases going down a column of the periodic table.Thus, HS– is more nucleophilic than HO–, and the halide reactivity order is I– > Br– > Cl–. Going down the periodic table, elementshavetheirvalenceelectronsinsuccessivelylargershellswheretheyaresuccessivelyfartherfrom the nucleus, less tightly held, and consequently more reactive.

Alternatively, an alcohol can be made more reactive toward nucleophilic substitution by treating it with para-toluenesulfonyl chloride to form a tosylate. As noted previously, tosylates areeven more reactive than halides in nucleophilic substitutions. Note that tosylate formation does not change the configuration of the oxygen-bearing carbon because the C–O bond is not broken.

Protic solvents—those that contain an –OH or –NH group—are generally the worst for SN2 reactions, while polar aprotic solvents, which are polar but don’t have an –OH or –NH group, are the best. Protic solvents, such as methanol and ethanol, slow down SN2 reactions by solvation of the reactant nucleophile. The solvent molecules hydrogen-bond to the nucleophile and form a cage around it, thereby lowering its energy and reactivity.

What effect would you expect these solvents to have on the reactivity of a nucleophile in SN2 reactions? A Summary of SN2 Reaction Characteristics The effects on SN2 reactions of the four variables—substrate structure, nucleophile, leaving group, and solvent—are summarized in the following statements and in the energy diagrams ofFIGURE 11.8: Substrate Steric hindrance raises the energy of the SN2 transition state, increasing ∆ G‡and decreasing the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.8a). As a result, SN2 reactions are best for methyl and primary substrates. Secondary substrates react slowly, and tertiary substrates do not react by an SN2 mechanism.

This alternative mechanism is called the SN1 reaction, for substitution, nucleophilic, unimolecular. In contrast to the SN2 reaction of CH3Br with OH–, the SN1 reaction of (CH3)3CBr with H2O has a rate that depends only on the alkyl halide concentration and is independent of the H2O concentration. In other words, the process is afirst-order reaction; the concentration of the nucleophile does not appear in the rate equation. To explain this result, we need to know more about kinetics measurements. Many organic reactions occur in severalsteps,oneofwhichusuallyhasahigher-energytransitionstatethantheothersandisthereforeslower. Wecallthisstepwiththehighesttransition-stateenergythe rate-limitingstep, orrate-determiningstep.No reactioncanproceedfasterthanitsrate-limitingstep,whichactsasakindoftrafficjam,orbottleneck.Inthe SN1 reaction of (CH3)3CBr with H2O, the fact that the nucleophile concentration does not appear in the first- order rate equation means that it is not involved in the rate-limiting step and must therefore be involved in some other, non-rate-limiting step. The mechanism shown inFIGURE 11.9 accounts for these observations. FIGURE 11.9MECHANISM The mechanism of the SN1 reaction of 2-bromo-2-methylpropane with H2O involves three steps.Step 1—the spontaneous, unimolecular dissociation of the alkyl bromide to yield a carbocation—is rate-limiting.

FIGURE 11.10 An energy diagram for an SN1 reaction.The rate-limiting step is the spontaneous dissociation of the alkyl halide to give a carbocation intermediate. Reaction of the carbocation with a nucleophile then occurs in a second, faster step. Because an SN1 reaction occurs through a carbocation intermediate, its stereochemical outcome is different from that of an SN2 reaction. Carbocations, as we’ve seen, are planar,sp2-hybridized, and achiral. Thus, if we carry out an SN1 reaction on one enantiomer of a chiral reactant and go through an achiral carbocation intermediate, the product loses its optical activity (Section 8.12). That is, the symmetrical intermediate carbocationcanreactwithanucleophileequallywellfromeitherside,leadingtoaracemic,50:50mixtureof enantiomers (FIGURE 11.11).

As a result, SN1 reactions are best for tertiary, allylic, and benzylic halides. Leaving group Good leaving groups increase the reaction rate by lowering the energy level of the transition state for carbocation formation. Nucleophile The nucleophile must be nonbasic to prevent a competitive elimination of HX (Section 11.7), but otherwise does not affect the reaction rate. Neutral nucleophiles work well.

The nucleophile can either substitute for the halide by reaction at carbon or can cause elimination of HX by reaction at a neighboring hydrogen: Elimination reactions are more complex than substitution reactions for several reasons. One is the problem of regiochemistry. What product results by loss of HX from an unsymmetrical halide? In fact, elimination reactionsalmostalwaysgivemixturesofalkeneproducts,andthebestwecanusuallydoistopredictwhichwill be the major product. According toZaitsev’s rule, formulated in 1875 by the Russian chemist Alexander Zaitsev, base-induced elimination reactions generally (although not always) give the more stable alkene product—that is, the alkene with more alkyl substituents on the double-bond carbons. In the following two cases, for example, the more highly substituted alkene product predominates. ZAITSEV’S RULE\n\nIn the elimination of HX from an alkyl halide, the more highly substituted alkene product predominates. Another factor that complicates a study of elimination reactions is that they can take place by different mechanisms,justassubstitutionscan.We’llconsiderthreeofthemostcommonmechanisms—theE1,E2,and E1cB reactions—which differ in the timing of C–H and C–X bond-breaking.

That is, both the base and alkyl halide take part in the rate-limiting step. A second piece of evidence in support of the E2 mechanism is provided by a phenomenon known as the deuterium isotope effect. For reasons that we won’t go into, a carbon–hydrogen bond is weaker by about 5 kJ/mol (1.2 kcal/mol) than the corresponding carbon–deuterium bond. Thus, a C–H bond is more easily broken than an equivalent C–D bond, and the rate of C–H bond cleavage is faster. For instance, the base- inducedeliminationofHBrfrom1-bromo-2-phenylethaneproceeds7.11timesfasterthanthecorresponding elimination of DBr from 1-bromo-2, 2-dideuterio-2-phenylethane. This result tells us that the C–H (or C–D) bondisbrokenintherate-limitingstep,consistentwithourpictureoftheE2reactionasaone-stepprocess.If it were otherwise, we wouldn’t observe a rate difference. Yet a third piece of mechanistic evidence involves the stereochemistry of E2 eliminations.

This can occur most easily if all the orbitals are in the same plane to begin with—that is, if they’re periplanar (FIGURE 11.19).

Anti periplanar geometry for E2 eliminations has specific stereochemical consequences that provide strong evidence for the proposed mechanism. To take just one example, meso-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane undergoes E2 elimination on treatment with base to give only theE alkene. None of the isomericZ alkene is\n\nformed because the transition state leading to theZalkene would have to have syn periplanar geometry and would thus be higher in energy.

Unlike the E2 reaction, where anti periplanargeometryisrequired,thereisnogeometricrequirementontheE1reactionbecausethehalideand the hydrogen are lost in separate steps.

But these advances did not come without a cost: Almost every chemical process produces waste that must be dealt with, including reaction solvents and toxic by-products that might evaporate into the air or be leached into groundwater if not disposed of properly. Even apparently harmless by-products must be safely buried or otherwise sequestered. As always, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. With the good also comes the bad. It may never be possible to make organic chemistry completely benign, but awareness of the environmental problems caused by many chemical processes has grown dramatically in recent years, giving rise to a movement called green chemistry.Green chemistry is the design and implementation of chemical products andprocessesthatreducewasteandattempttoeliminatethegenerationofhazardoussubstances.Thereare12 principles of green chemistry: Prevent waste– Waste should be prevented rather than treated or cleaned up after it has been created.

Use less hazardous processes– Synthetic methods should use reactants and generate wastes with minimal toxicity to health and the environment. Design safer chemicals– Chemical products should be designed to have minimal toxicity. Use safer solvents– Minimal use should be made of solvents, separation agents, and other auxiliary substances in a reaction. Design for energy efficiency– Energy requirements for chemical processes should be minimized, with reactions carried out at room temperature if possible. Use renewable feedstocks– Raw materials should come from renewable sources when feasible.

Every time a reaction is run, the products must be identified, and every time a new compound is found in nature, its structure must be determined. Determining the structure of an organic compound was a difficult andtime-consumingprocessuntilthemid-20thcentury,butpowerfultechniquesandspecializedinstruments are now routinely used to simplify the problem. In this and the next two chapters, we’ll look at four such techniques—mass spectrometry (MS), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), and nuclear magneticresonancespectroscopy(NMR)—andwe’llseethekindofinformationthatcanbeobtainedfromeach. Mass spectrometry What is the size and formula? Infrared spectroscopy What functional groups are present? Ultraviolet spectroscopy Is a conjugated πelectron system present? Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy What is the carbon–hydrogen framework? 12.1Mass Spectrometry of Small Molecules: Magnetic-Sector Instruments At itssimplest, massspectrometry(MS) isatechniqueformeasuringthemass,andthereforethemolecular weight(MW),ofamolecule.Inaddition,it’softenpossibletogainstructuralinformationaboutamoleculeby measuring the masses of the fragments produced when molecules are broken apart. More than 20 different kinds of commercial mass spectrometers are available depending on the intended application, but all have three basic parts: anionization sourcein which sample molecules are given an electricalcharge,a massanalyzer in whichionsareseparatedbytheirmass-to-chargeratio,anda detectorin which the separated ions are observed and counted. Among the most common mass spectrometers used for routine purposes in the laboratory is the electron- impact, magnetic-sector instrument shown schematically inFIGURE 12.2. A small amount of sample is vaporizedintotheionizationsource,whereitisbombardedbyastreamofhigh-energyelectrons.Theenergyof theelectronbeamcanbevariedbutiscommonlyaround70electronvolts(eV),or6700kJ/mol.Whenahigh- energy electron strikes an organic molecule, it dislodges a valence electron from the molecule, producing a cationradical— cationbecause themoleculehaslostanelectronandnowhasapositivecharge; radicalbecause the molecule now has an odd number of electrons. Electron bombardment transfers so much energy that most of the cation radicals fragment after formation. Theybreakapartintosmallerpieces,someofwhichretainthepositivechargeandsomeofwhichareneutral.

Some instruments, calleddouble-focusing mass spectrometers, have two magnetic sectors in their mass analyzers, giving these spectrometers have such high resolution that they provide mass measurements accurateto5ppm,orabout0.0005amu,makingitpossibletodistinguishbetweentwoformulaswiththesame nominalmass.Forexample,bothC 5H12 andC4H8OhaveMW=72,buttheydifferslightlybeyondthedecimal point: C5H12 has an exact mass of 72.0939 amu, whereas C4H8O has an exact mass of 72.0575 amu. A high- resolutioninstrumentcaneasilydistinguishbetweenthem.Note,however,thatexactmassmeasurementsrefer to molecules with specific isotopic compositions. Thus, the sum of the exact atomic masses of the specific isotopesinamoleculeismeasured—1.00783amufor 1H,12.00000amufor 12C,14.00307amufor 14N,15.994 91amufor 16O,andsoon—ratherthanthesumoftheaverageatomicmassesofelements,asfoundonaperiodic table.

There isalsoasmallpeakatM+1duetothepresenceofdifferentisotopesinthemolecules.Although 12Cisthemost abundant carbon isotope, a small amount (1.10% natural abundance) of13C is also present. Thus, a certain percentageofthemoleculesanalyzedinthemassspectrometerarelikelytocontaina 13Catom,givingriseto theobservedM+1peak.Inaddition,asmallamountof 2H(deuterium;0.015%naturalabundance)ispresent, making a further contribution to the M + 1 peak. Massspectrometrywouldbeusefulevenifmolecularweightandformulaweretheonlyinformationthatcould be obtained, but in fact it provides much more. For one thing, the mass spectrum of a compound serves as a kindof“molecularfingerprint.”Everyorganiccompoundfragmentsinauniquewaydependingonitsstructure, and the likelihood of two compounds having identical mass spectra is small. Thus, it’s sometimes possible to identify an unknown by computer-based matching of its mass spectrum to one of the more than 785,061 searchable spectra recorded in a database called the Registry of Mass Spectral Data. It’s also possible to derive structural information about a molecule by interpreting its fragmentation pattern. Fragmentation occurs when the high-energy cation radical flies apart by spontaneous cleavage of a chemical bond.Oneofthetwofragmentsretainsthepositivechargeandisacarbocation,whiletheotherfragmentisa neutral radical. Not surprisingly, the positive charge often remains with the fragment that is best able to stabilize it. In other words,arelativelystablecarbocationisoftenformedduringfragmentation.Forexample,2,2-dimethylpropane tends to fragment in such a way that the positive charge remains with the tert-butyl group. 2,2-Dimethylpropane therefore has a base peak atm/z= 57, corresponding to C4H9+(FIGURE 12.5). Because mass-spectral fragmentation patterns are usually complex, it’s often difficult to assign structures to fragmentions.Mosthydrocarbonsfragmentinmanyways,asdemonstratedbythemassspectrumofhexanein FIGURE 12.6.Thehexanespectrumshowsamoderatelyabundantmolecularionat m/z= 86andfragmentions atm/z= 71,57,43,and29.Sinceallthecarbon–carbonbondsofhexaneareelectronicallysimilar,allbreakto a similar extent, giving rise to the observed mixture of ions.

Instead, they typically use either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), typically linked to a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. Both ESI and MALDI are soft ionization methods that produce charged molecules with little fragmentation, even with sensitive biological samples of very high molecular weight. In an ESI source, as a sample solution exits the tube, it is subjected to a high voltage that causes the droplets to become charged. The sample molecules gain one or more protons from charged solvent molecules in the droplet.Thevolatilesolventquicklyevaporates,givingvariablyprotonatedsamplemolecules(M+H nn+). Ina MALDI source, the sample is adsorbed onto a suitable matrix compound, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, whichisionizedbyashortburstoflaserlight.Thematrixcompoundthentransferstheenergytothesample and protonates it, forming M + H nn+ions.

Why does an organic molecule absorb some wavelengths of IR radiation but not others? All molecules have a certain amount of energy and are in constant motion.

Strategy All IR spectra have many absorptions, but those useful for identifying specific functional groups are usually foundintheregionfrom1500cm –1to3300cm –1.Payparticularattentiontothecarbonylregion(1670to1780 cm–1),thearomaticregion(1660to2000cm –1),thetriple-bondregion(2000to2500cm –1),andtheC–Hregion (2500 to 3500 cm–1).\n\nSolution The spectrum shows an intense absorption at 1725 cm–1 due to a carbonyl group (perhaps an aldehyde, –CHO), a series of weak absorptions from 1800 to 2000 cm–1 characteristic of aromatic compounds, and a C–H absorption near 3030 cm–1, also characteristic of aromatic compounds. In fact, the compound is phenylacetaldehyde. PROBLEM 12-9 The IR spectrum of phenylacetylene is shown in Figure 12.29. What absorption bands can you identify?

The structure of an organic molecule is usually determined using spectroscopic methods, including mass spectrometry and infraredspectroscopy. Massspectrometry(MS) tellsthemolecularweightandformulaofamolecule; infrared (IR) spectroscopyidentifies the functional groups present in the molecule. In small-molecule mass spectrometry, molecules are first ionized by collision with a high-energy electron beam. The ions then fragment into smaller pieces, which are magnetically sorted according to their mass- to-charge ratio ( m/z). The ionized sample molecule is called themolecular ion, M+, and measurement of its mass gives the molecular weight of the sample. Structural clues about unknown samples can be obtained by interpretingthefragmentationpatternofthemolecularion.Mass-spectralfragmentationsareusuallycomplex, however,andinterpretationisoftendifficult.Inbiologicalmassspectrometry,moleculesareprotonatedusing eitherelectrosprayionization(ESI)ormatrix-assistedlaserdesorptionionization(MALDI),andtheprotonated molecules are separated by time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis. Infraredspectroscopyinvolvestheinteractionofamoleculewith electromagneticradiation.Whenanorganic moleculeisirradiatedwithinfraredenergy,certain frequenciesareabsorbedbythemolecule.Thefrequencies absorbed correspond to the amounts of energy needed to increase the amplitude of specific molecular vibrationssuchasbondstretchingandbending.Sinceeveryfunctionalgrouphasacharacteristiccombination of bonds, every functional group has a characteristic set of infrared absorptions. For example, the terminal alkyne bondabsorbsIRradiationof3300cm –1,andthealkene bondabsorbsintherange1640to 1680cm–1.Byobservingwhichfrequenciesofinfraredradiationareabsorbedbyamoleculeandwhicharenot, it’s possible to determine the functional groups a molecule contains.

Furthermore, a CAS name must be strictly systematic so that it can be assigned and interpreted by computers; common names are not allowed. People, however, have different requirements than computers. For people—which is to say students and professional chemists in their spoken and written communications—it’s best that a chemical name be pronounceable and as easy as possible to assign and interpret. Furthermore, it’s convenient if names follow historicalprecedents,evenifthatmeansaparticularlywell-knowncompoundmighthavemorethanonename. People can readily understand that bromomethane and methyl bromide both refer to CH3Br.

Similarly, amino alcohol2 must be named either as an alcohol (-ol) or as an amine (-amine), but it can’t be named as an -olamineor -aminol. The only exception to the rule requiring a single suffix is when naming compounds that have double or triple bonds. Thus, the unsaturated acid is 3-butenoic acid, and the acetylenic alcohol is 5-pentyn-1-ol. How do we choose which suffix to use?

For example, compounds6 and 7 are isomeric aldehydo amides, which must be named as amides rather than as aldehydes according toTABLE A2. The longest chain in compound\n\n6 has six carbons, and the substance is named 5-methyl-6-oxohexanamide. Compound7 also has a chain of sixcarbons,butthelongestchainthatcontainsbothprincipalfunctionalgroupshasonlyfourcarbons.Thus, compound7is named 4-oxo-3-propylbutanamide. If the highest-priority principal group is attached to a ring, the parent name is that of the ring system. Compounds 8 and 9, for instance, are isomeric keto nitriles and must both be named as nitriles according to TABLE A2. Substance8 is named as a benzonitrile because the −CN functional group is a substituent on the aromatic ring, but substance9 is named as an acetonitrile because the −CN functional group is on an open chain. Thus, their names are 2-acetyl-(4-bromomethyl)benzonitrile (8) and (2-acetyl-4-bromophenyl)acetonitrile(9).Asfurtherexamples,compounds 10and11arebothketoacidsand must be named as acids, but the parent name in10 is that of a ring system (cyclohexanecarboxylic acid) and the parent name in 11 is that of an open chain (propanoic acid). Thus, their names are trans-2-(3-oxopropyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid(10)and 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoic acid(11). Name Parts 3 and 4. The Prefixes and Locants With the parent name and the suffix established, the next step is to identify and give numbers, orlocants, to all substituents on the parent chain or ring. The substituents include all alkyl groups and all functional groups other than the one cited in the suffix. For example, compound12 contains three different functional groups(carboxyl,keto,anddoublebond).Becausethecarboxylgroupishighestinpriorityandthelongestchain containingthefunctionalgroupshassevencarbons,compound 12isaheptenoicacid.Inaddition,theparent chainhasaketo(oxo)substituentandthreemethylgroups.Numberingfromtheendnearerthehighest-priority functional group gives the name ( E)-2,5,5-trimethyl-4-oxo-2-heptenoic acid.
